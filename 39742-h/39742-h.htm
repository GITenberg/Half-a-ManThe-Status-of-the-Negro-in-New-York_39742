<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>


<p>Miss Ovington's description of the status
of the Negro in New York City is based on
a most painstaking inquiry into his social
and economic conditions, and brings out in
the most forceful way the difficulties under
which the race is laboring, even in the large
cosmopolitan population of New York. It
is a refutation of the claims that the Negro
has equal opportunity with the whites, and
that his failure to advance more rapidly
than he has, is due to innate inability.</p>

<p>Many students of anthropology recognize
that no proof can be given of any material
inferiority of the Negro race; that without
doubt the bulk of the individuals composing
the race are equal in mental aptitude to
the bulk of our own people; that, although
their hereditary aptitudes may lie in slightly
different directions, it is very improbable
that the majority of individuals composing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
the white race should possess greater ability
than the Negro race.</p>

<p>The anthropological argument is invariably
met by the objection that the achievements
of the two races are unequal, while
their opportunities are the same. Every
demonstration of the inequality of opportunity
will therefore help to dissipate
prejudices that prevent the best possible
development of a large number of our
citizens.</p>

<p>The Negro of our times carries even more
heavily the burden of his racial descent
than did the Jew of an earlier period; and
the intellectual and moral qualities required
to insure success to the Negro are infinitely
greater than those demanded from the white,
and will be the greater, the stricter the
segregation of the Negro community.</p>

<p>The strong development of racial consciousness,
which has been increasing during
the last century and is just beginning to
show the first signs of waning, is the gravest
obstacle to the progress of the Negro race,
as it is an obstacle to the progress of all
strongly individualized social groups. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
simple presentation of observations, like
those given by Miss Ovington, may help us
to overcome more quickly that self-centred
attitude which can see progress only in the
domination of a single type.</p>

<p>This investigation was carried on by
Miss Ovington under the auspices of the
Greenwich House Committee on Social
Investigations, of which she was a Fellow.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Six years ago I met a young colored man,
a college student recently returned from
Germany where he had been engaged in
graduate work. He was born, he told me,
in one of the Gulf States, and I questioned
him as to whether he intended going back
to the South to teach. His answer was in
the negative. "My father has attained success
in his native state," he said, "but when
I ceased to be a boy, he advised me to live
in the North where my manhood would be
respected. He himself cannot continually
endure the position in which he is placed,
and in the summer he comes North to be a
man. No," correcting himself, "to be half
a man. A Negro is wholly a man only in
Europe."</p>

<p>Half a man! During the six years that I
have been in touch with the problem of the
Negro in New York this characterization has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
grown in significance to me. I have endeavored
to know the life of the Negro as I know
the life of the white American, and I have
learned that while New York at times gives
full recognition to his manhood, again, its
race prejudice arrests his development as
certainly as severe poverty arrests the development
of the tenement child. Perhaps
a study of this shifting attitude on the part
of the dominant race, and of the Negro's
reaction under it, may not be unimportant;
for the color question cannot be ignored in
America, nor should the position taken by
her largest city be overlooked. And those
who love their fellows may be glad, among
New York's four millions&mdash;its Slavs and
Italians, its Russians and Asiatics&mdash;to meet
these dark people who speak our language
and who for many generations have made
this country their home.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

"<span class="smcap">Up from Slavery</span>"</h2>


<p>The status of the Negro in New Amsterdam,
a slave in a pioneer community, differed
fundamentally from his position today
in New York. His history from the seventeenth
to the twentieth century contains
many exciting incidents, but those only
need be considered here that show a progress
or a retardation in his attainment to
manhood. What were his struggles in the
past to secure his rights as a man?</p>

<p>Slavery in the early days of the colonies
was more brutal than at the time of final
emancipation. Savages recently arrived
from Africa lacked the docility of blacks
reared in bondage, and burning and torturing,
as well as whipping, were recognized
modes of punishment. Masters looked upon
their Negroes, bought at the Wall Street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
market from among the cargo of a recently
arrived slaver, with some suspicion and
fear. Nor were their apprehensions entirely
without reason. In 1712 some of
the discontented among the New York
slaves met in an orchard in Maiden Lane
and set fire to an outhouse. Defending
themselves against the citizens who ran to
put out the flames, they fired, killing nine
men and wounding six. Retribution soon
followed. They were pursued when they
attempted flight, captured and executed&mdash;some
hanged, some burned at the stake,
some left suspended in chains to starve to
death.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the memory of this small
revolt that caused the people of New York
in 1741 to lay the blame for a series of conflagrations
upon their slaves. Nine fires
that seemed to be incendiary came one upon
another, and a robbery was committed.
To escape death herself, a worthless white
servant girl gave testimony against the
Negroes who frequented a tavern where she
was employed, declaring that a plot had
been conceived whereby the slaves would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
kill all the white men and take control
of the city. New York was aflame with
fear, and evidence that at another time
would have been rejected, was listened to
by the judges with grave attention. The
slaves were allowed no defence, and before
the city had recovered from its fright, it
had burned fourteen Negroes, hanged eighteen,
and transported seventy-one.<a name="FNanchor_2_1" id="FNanchor_2_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Historians today think that the slaves
were in no way concerned in this so-called
"plot." The two thousand blacks in the
city might have done much mischief to the
ten thousand whites, but their servile condition
made an organized movement among
them impossible. We may infer, however,
from the fear which they provoked, that
they were not all docile servants. In a
letter written at the port of New York in
1756, an English naval officer says of the
city, "The laborious people in general are
Guinea Negroes who lie under particular
restraints from the attempts they have
made to massacre the inhabitants for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
liberty."<a name="FNanchor_3_2" id="FNanchor_3_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Janvier in his "Old New York"
thinks, "that the alarm bred by the so-called
Negro plot of 1741 was most effective
in checking the growth of slavery in that
city." Probably the restlessness of the slaves,
their efforts toward manhood, in a community
where there was little economic justification
for slavery, contributed to the movement
for emancipation that began in 1777.</p>

<p>Emancipation came gradually to the New
York Negro. Gouverneur Morris at the
state constitutional convention of 1776-1777
recommended that "the future legislature
of the state of New York take the most
effectual measures consistent with the public
safety and the private property of individuals
for abolishing domestic slavery within
the same, so that in future ages every human
being who breathes the air of this state shall
enjoy the privileges of a freeman." The
postponement of action to a future legislature
was keenly regretted by John Jay,
who was absent from the convention when
the slavery question arose, but who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
hoped that New York might be a leader in
emancipation. The state's initial measure
for abolishing slavery was in 1785, when it
prohibited the sale of slaves in New York.
This was followed in 1799 by an act giving
freedom to the children of slaves, and in
1817 by a further act providing for the abolition
of slavery throughout the state in
1827. This law went into effect July 4,
1827, the emancipation day of the Negroes
in New York.</p>

<p>With gradual emancipation and the cessation
of the sale of slaves, the Negroes numerically
became unimportant in the city. In
1800 they constituted ten and a half per
cent of the population. Half a century
later, while they had doubled their numbers,
the immense influx of foreign immigrants
brought their proportion down to two and
seven-tenths per cent. In 1850 and 1860
their positive as well as <a name="tn2" id="tn2"></a>their relative number
decreased, and it was not until twenty
years ago that they began to show some
gain. The last census returns of 1900 give
Greater New York (including Brooklyn)
60,666 Negroes in a population of 3,437,202,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
one and eight-tenths per cent. It seems probable
that the census of 1910 will show a large
positive and a slight relative Negro increase.<a name="FNanchor_4_3" id="FNanchor_4_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The relative decrease in the number of
Negroes did not, however, produce a decrease
in the agitation upon their presence
and position in the city. Their political
status was a subject for heated discussion
even before their complete emancipation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
The first state constitution, drafted in 1777,
was without color discrimination, since it
based the suffrage upon a property qualification
requiring voters for governor and
senators to be freeholders owning property
worth 100. A Negro with such a holding
was a phenomenon, a curiosity. But by
1821, when the framing of the second constitution
was in progress, Negroes of some
education were an appreciable element in
the population, and with them ignorant,
recently emancipated slaves. Should they
be admitted to the full manhood suffrage
contemplated for the whites? Those who
favored the new democratic movement were
doubtful of its applicability to colored people.
Livingston, a champion of universal white
manhood suffrage, was against giving the
black man the vote. On the other hand,
the conservative Chancellor Kent, apprehending
in the new constitution "a disposition
to encroach on private rights,&mdash;to
disturb chartered privileges and to weaken,
degrade, and overawe the administration of
justice," would yet have made no color
discrimination, and Peter A. Jay, who did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
not believe in universal white manhood
suffrage, urged that colored men, natives of
the country, should derive from its institutions
the same privileges as white persons.
The second constitution when adopted enfranchised
practically all white men, but
gave the Negroes a property qualification of
$250. The issue of the revolution, however,
was not far from men's thoughts, and "taxation
without representation" was not permitted;
for while no colored man might vote
without a freehold estate valued at 250 dollars,
<i>no person of color was subject to direct
taxation unless he should be possessed of such
real estate</i>.</p>

<p>In 1846 a third constitutional convention
was held, and the same matter came up for
debate. John L. Russell of St. Lawrence
declared that "the Almighty had created
the black man inferior to the white man,"
while Daniel S. Waterbury of Delaware
County believed that "the argument that
because a race of men is marked by a peculiarity
of color and crooked hair they are not
endowed with a mind equal to another class
who have other peculiarities is unworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of men of sense." John H. Hunt of New
York City proclaimed that "We want no
masters, least of all no Negro masters....
Negroes are aliens." And he predicted that
the practical effect of their admission to the
suffrage would be their exclusion from Manhattan
Island. A delegation of colored men
appeared at Albany before the suffrage committee,
but their arguments and those of
their friends produced no effect. The new
constitution contained the same Negro property
qualification, and it was not until 1874,
after the passage of the fifteenth amendment
to the Constitution of the United
States, that legislation placed the Negro
voter of New York upon the same footing
as the white.<a name="FNanchor_5_4" id="FNanchor_5_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Had New York sincerely desired to keep
the Negro in an inferior position, it could
have accomplished this by refusing him an
education. This it never did, though it
suffered much tribulation regarding the place
and manner of his instruction. Before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
establishment of a public school system, the
Manumission society, an association composed
largely of Friends, though including
in its membership John Jay, De Witt Clinton,
and Alexander Hamilton, undertook
the education of the Negro. In 1787 it
opened a school for Africans on Cliff Street.
One of the early teachers was Charles C.
Andrews, whose little book on "The African
Free Schools," published in 1830, shows
a kindly tolerance for the black race. "As
a result of forty years' experience," he writes,
"the idea respecting the capacity of the
African race to receive a respectable and
even a liberal education has not been visionary."
And he recites the names of some
of his pupils: "Rev. Theodore S. Wright,
graduate of Princeton Theological Seminary;
John B. Russworm, graduate of Bowdoin;
Edward Jones, graduate of Amherst; William
Brown and William G. Smith, students
of the medical department, Columbia College:
all of them persons of color." Describing
an annual exhibition of his school on
May 12, 1824, he quotes from the <i>Commercial
Advertiser</i> of the same date: "We never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
beheld a white school, of the same age (of
and under the age of fifteen), in which, without
exception, there was more order and
neatness of dress and cleanliness of person.
And the exercises were performed with a
degree of promptness and accuracy which
was surprising."</p>

<p>In 1834 the public school association took
over the schools of the Manumission society,
but before this time the Negroes
had begun to assert themselves regarding
the method and place of instruction for
their children. They clamored for colored
teachers and succeeded in displacing Charles
Andrews himself. In 1838, at their desire,
the word African was changed to colored in
describing the race; but of chief importance
to their educational future, they began a
protest, only to end in 1900, against segregation.</p>

<p>Removed from the care of the Manumission
society, the colored schools deteriorated.
Their grade was reduced,<a name="FNanchor_6_5" id="FNanchor_6_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and owing to
the growth of the city, their attendance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
very irregular, the severe winter weather
often keeping children who lived at a distance
at home. A Brooklyn man tells me
that, when a boy, he used to walk from his
home at East New York to Fulton Ferry,
passing inferior Brooklyn colored schools,
and after crossing the river, on up to Mulberry
Street to be instructed by the popular
colored teacher, John Peterson. Here he
received a good education; but few boys
would have endured a daily trip of fourteen
miles. Increasingly parents, if the colored
school of their neighborhood was not of
the best, sent their boys and girls to be
instructed with the white boys and girls of
their district.</p>

<p>The state law declared that any city or
incorporated village might establish separate
schools for the instruction of African
youths, provided the facilities were equal to
those of white schools, and when, in <a name="tn1" id="tn1"></a>1862,
a colored parent brought a case against the
city for forcing her child to go to a colored
school, the case was lost.<a name="FNanchor_7_6" id="FNanchor_7_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Nevertheless,
during the nineteenth century Negroes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
some numbers attended white schools in
both Brooklyn and New York, and Negro
parents continued in their quiet but persistent
efforts against segregation. Then again,
New York grew too rapidly to segregate
any race. The Negro boys and girls were
scattered through many districts, and the attendance
at colored schools fell off; in 1879
it was less than in 1878, and in 1880 less
than in 1879; so that the Board of Education
in 1883 decided to disestablish three
colored schools.</p>

<p>But this involved another factor. If the
colored schools were disestablished, what
would become of the colored teachers? The
Negroes met this issue by delaying disestablishment
for a year, while the teachers
went about among the parents of the ward,
making friends and urging that children,
<i>white or colored</i>, be sent to their schools.
Numbers of new pupils of both races were
brought in within the year, and at the end
of the time, after a hearing before the
governor, then Grover Cleveland, a bill was
passed prohibiting the abolition of two of
the three colored schools, but also making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
them open to all children regardless of
color.<a name="FNanchor_8_7" id="FNanchor_8_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Occasionally a colored girl graduated from
the normal college of the city, but if there
was no vacancy for her in the four colored
schools she received no appointment. In
1896, however, a normal graduate, Miss
S. E. Frazier, insisted upon her right to be
appointed as teacher in any school in which
there was a vacancy. She visited the ward
trustees and the members of the Board of
Education, and represented to them the
injustice done her and her race in refusing
her the chance to prove her ability as a
teacher in the first school that should need
a normal graduate. She was finally appointed
to a position in a white school.
Her success with her pupils was immediate,
and since then the question of race or color
has not been considered in the appointment
of teachers in New York.</p>

<p>Until 1900, the state law permitted the
establishment of separate colored schools.
In that year, however, on the initiative
of Theodore Roosevelt, then governor, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
legislature passed a bill providing that no
person should be refused admission or be
excluded from any public school in the state
on account of race or color.<a name="FNanchor_9_8" id="FNanchor_9_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This closed
the question of compulsory segregation in
the state, though before this it had ceased
in New York. Public education was thus
democratized for the New York Negroes,
their persistent efforts bringing at the end
complete success.</p>

<p>While the colored people in New York
started with segregated schools and attained
to mixed schools, the movement in the
churches was the reverse. At first the
Negroes were attendants of white churches,
sitting in the gallery or on the rear seats,
and waiting until the white people were
through before partaking of the communion;
but as their number increased they chafed
under their position. Why should they be
placed apart to hear the doctrine of Christ,
and why, too, should they not have full
opportunity to preach that doctrine? The
desire for self-expression was perhaps the
greatest factor in leading them to separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
from the white church. In 1796 about
thirty Negroes, under the leadership of
James Varick,<a name="FNanchor_10_9" id="FNanchor_10_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> withdrew from the John
Street Methodist Episcopal Church, and
formed the first colored church of New York.
Varick had been denied a license to preach,
but now as pastor of his own people, he
was recognized by the whites and helped
by some of them. He was the founder
of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion
Church.</p>

<p>The Abyssinian Baptist Church was organized
in 1800 by a few colored members who
withdrew from the First Baptist Church,
then in Gold Street, to establish themselves
on Worth Street,<a name="FNanchor_11_10" id="FNanchor_11_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and in 1818 the colored
Episcopalians organized St. Philip's Church.
In 1820 one of their race, Peter Williams,
for six years deacon, became their preacher.</p>

<p>Another prominent church was the colored
Congregational, situated, in 1854, on
Sixth Street; and it was the determined
effort of its woman organist to reach the
church in time to perform her part in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Sunday morning service that led to an important
Negro advance in citizenship.</p>

<p>In the middle of the last century the right
of the Negro to ride in car or omnibus
depended on the sufferance of driver, conductor,
and passenger. Sometimes a car
stopped at a Negro's signal, again the driver
whipped up his horses, while the conductor
yelled to the "nigger" to wait for the next
car. Entrance might always be effected if
in the company of a white person, and the
small child of a kindly white household
would be delegated to accompany the homeward
bound black visitor into her car where,
after a few minutes, conductor and passengers
having become accustomed to her
presence, the young protector might slip
away. Such a situation was very galling
to the self-respecting negro.</p>

<p>In July, 1854, Elizabeth Jennings, a colored
school-teacher and organist at the Congregational
Church, attempted to board a
Third Avenue car at Pearl and Chatham
Streets. She was hurrying to reach the
church to perform her part in the service.
The conductor stopped, but as Miss Jen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>nings
mounted the platform, he told her that
she must wait for the next car, which was
reserved for her people. "I have no people,"
Miss Jennings said. "I wish to go to church
as I have for six months past, and I do not
wish to be detained." The altercation continued
until the car behind came up, and the
driver there declaring that he had less room
than the car in front, the woman was grudgingly
allowed to enter the car. "Remember,"
the conductor said, "if any passenger
objects, you shall go out, whether or no, or
I'll put you out."</p>

<p>"I am a respectable person, born and
brought up in New York," said Miss Jennings,
"and I was never insulted so before."</p>

<p>This again aroused the conductor. "I
was born in Ireland," he said, "and you've
got to get out of this car."</p>

<p>He attempted to drag her out. The woman
clung to the window, the conductor called
in the driver to help him, and together they
dragged and pulled and at last threw her
into the street. Badly hurt, she nevertheless
jumped back into the car. The driver
galloped his horses down the street, passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
every one until a policeman was found who
pushed the woman out, not, however, until
she had taken the number of the car. She
then made her way home.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Jennings took the case into court,
and it came before the Supreme Court of
the State in February, 1855, Chester A.
Arthur, afterwards President of the United
States, being one of the lawyers for the
plaintiff. The judge's charge was clear
on the point that common carriers were
bound to carry all respectable people, white
or colored, and the plaintiff was given $225
damages, to which the court added ten per
cent and costs; and to quote the New York
<i>Tribune's</i> comment on the case,<a name="FNanchor_12_11" id="FNanchor_12_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> "Railroads,
steamboats, omnibuses, and ferryboats will
be admonished from this as to the rights of
respectable colored people."<a name="FNanchor_13_12" id="FNanchor_13_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>When you talk with the elderly educated
colored people of New York today, they tell
you that before the War were "dark days."
The responsibility felt by the thoughtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Negroes was very great. They had not only
their own battles to wage, but there were
the fugitives who were entering the city
by the Underground Railroad, whom they
must assist though it cost them their own
liberty. In 1835 a Vigilance Committee
was formed in New York City to take charge
of all escaping slaves, and also to prevent
the arrest and return to slavery of free men
of color. Colored men served on this Committee,
and its secretary was the minister
of the church to which Elizabeth Jennings
was endeavoring to make her way that
Sunday morning, the Reverend Charles B.
Ray. In 1850 the New York State Vigilance
Committee was formed with Gerritt
Smith as President and Ray as Secretary.
Ray's home was frequently used to shelter
fugitives.<a name="FNanchor_14_13" id="FNanchor_14_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Once a young man, stepping up
to the door and learning that it was Charles
Ray's house, whistled to his companions in
the darkness, and fourteen black men made
their appearance and received shelter. There
would also come the task of negotiating for
the purchase of a slave, or this proving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
impossible, for the careful working out of a
means for his escape. Dark days, indeed,
but made memorable to the Negro by heroic
work and the friendship of great men.
Perhaps the two races have never worked
together in such fine companionship as at
the unlawful and thrilling task of protecting
and aiding the fugitive.</p>

<p>The hardest year of the century for the
Negro was 1863, when the draft riot imperilled
every dark face. Many Negroes
fled from the city. Colored homes were
fired, the Orphan Asylum for colored children
on Fifth Avenue was burned, and even
the dead might not be buried save at the
peril of undertaker and priest. Elizabeth
Jennings, now Mrs. Graham, lost a child
when the rioting was at its height. An
undertaker named Winterbottom, a white
man, was brave enough to give his services,
winning the lasting gratitude and patronage
of the colored people. With the danger
of violence about them, the father and
mother went to Greenwood Cemetery, where
the Reverend Morgan Dix of Trinity Church
read the burial service at the grave.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>With the end of the War and the passage
of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments
came a revulsion of feeling for the race.
"I remember," an old time friend of the
Negro tells me, "when the fifteenth amendment
was passed. The colored people stood
in great numbers on the streets, and on their
faces was a look of gratitude and thanksgiving
that I shall never forget." Following
the amendment came the State Civil
Rights Bill in 1873, declaring that all persons
should be entitled to full and equal
accommodations in all public places; and
discrimination for a time largely ceased.</p>

<p>While the colored people were winning
citizenship, their progress in industry was
also considerable. Until 1860 the race was
infrequently segregated, and black and white
were neighbors, not only in their homes, but
in business. Samuel R. Scottron, a careful
Negro writer, compiled a long list of the
trades in which Negroes engaged before
the War. Besides the various lines of domestic
service, in which they were more
frequently seen than today&mdash;coachmen,
cooks, waitresses, seamstresses, barbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>&mdash;there
were many craftsmen, ship-builders,
trimmers, riggers, coopers, caulkers, printers,
tailors, carpenters. "Second-hand clothing
shops were everywhere kept by colored men.
All the caterers and restaurant keepers of
the high order, as well as small places, were
kept by colored men.... Varick and
Peters kept about the most pretentious barber
shop in the city. Patrick Reason was
one of the most capable engravers. The
greatest among the restaurateurs was
Thomas Downing, who kept a restaurant
under what is now the Drexel Building,
corner of Wall and Broad Streets. The
drug stores of Dr. James McCune Smith on
West Broadway, and Dr. Philip A. White
on Frankfort Street, were not outclassed by
any kept by white men in their day."<a name="FNanchor_15_14" id="FNanchor_15_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>And so the list goes on. It is perhaps
somewhat exaggerated in the importance
in the city's business life which it gives to
the colored race. Charles Andrews, in 1837,
says of the pupil who graduates from his
school, "He leaves with every avenue closed
against him&mdash;doomed to encounter as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
prejudice and contempt as if he were not
only destitute of that education which distinguishes
the civilized from the savage, but
as if he were incapable of receiving it."
And he goes on to tell of those few who have
been able to learn trades, and their subsequent
difficulties in finding employment in
good shops. White journeymen object to
working in the same shop with them, and
many of the best lads go to sea or become
waiters, barbers, coachmen, servants, laborers.
But he is writing of an early date,
and the opinion of the colored people seems
to be that, before our large foreign immigration,
the Negro was more needed in New
York than today and received a large share
of satisfactory employment. His chief competitor
was the Irish immigrant, like himself
an agricultural laborer, without previous
training in business, and he was frequently
able to hold his own in his shop. His long
experience in domestic service, moreover,
made him a better caterer than the representatives
of any other nationality that had
yet entered the city. His churches were
flourishing, thus securing a profession for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
which he had natural ability, and as we have
seen, colored men and women taught in the
New York schools.</p>

<p>The city grew rapidly after 1875, and the
colored society, the little group that had
attained to modest means and education,
bought homes, chiefly in Brooklyn, where
land was easier to secure than in Manhattan,
and strove to enlarge the opportunities for
those who were to come after them. Color
prejudice had waned, and they often met
with especial consideration because of their
race. Had they been white they would
have slipped into the population and been
lost, as happened to the Germans and the
Irish, who had been their competitors. As
it was, they formed a society apart from the
rest of the city, meeting it occasionally in
work or through the friendship of children,
who, left to themselves, know no race.
They had battled against prejudice and had
won their rights as citizens.</p>

<p>As we look at the life of a segregated
people, however, we see that we tend always
to regard not the individual but the group.
The Negro is a man in Europe, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
there he is an individual, standing or falling
by his own merits. But in America,
even in so cosmopolitan a city as New York,
he is judged, not by his own achievements,
but by the achievements of every other
New York black man. So we will leave
these able colored Americans, who won much
both for themselves and for their race, and
turn to the mass of the Negroes, the toiling
poor, who dwell in our tenements today.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<span class="smcap">Where the Negro Lives</span></h2>


<p>It is thirty-five years since, in his Symphony,
Sidney Lanier told of</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"The poor</span><br />
That stand by the inward opening door<br />
Trade's hand doth tighten evermore,<br />
And sigh their monstrous foul air sigh<br />
For the outside hills of liberty."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Were Lanier writing this today, we should
wonder whether New York's crowded tenements
had not served as inspiration for his
figure. The island of Manhattan, about
eight miles long by two miles wide, with an
additional slender triangle of five miles at
the north end, in 1905, housed two million
one hundred and twelve thousand people.
These men and women and children were not
scattered uniformly throughout the island,
but were placed in selected corners, one thousand
to the acre, while a mile or so away
large comfortable homes held families of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
or three. This was Manhattan's condition
in 1905, and with each succeeding year more
congestion takes place, and more pressure is
felt upon the inward opening door.<a name="FNanchor_16_1" id="FNanchor_16_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Negro with the rest of the poor of
New York has his part in this excessive
overcrowding. The slaver in which he made
his entrance to this land provided in floor
space six feet by one-foot-four for a man,
five feet by one-foot-four for a woman, and
four feet by one-foot-four for a child.<a name="FNanchor_17_2" id="FNanchor_17_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This
outdoes any overcrowding New York can
produce, but an ever increasing cost in food
and rent is bringing into her interior bedrooms
a mass of humanity approximating
that of the slaver's ship. These new-comers,
however, are not unwilling occupants, since
unlike the slaves they may spend their day
and much of their night amid an ocean of
changing and exciting incidents. If you are
young and strong, you care less where you
sleep than where you may spend your
waking hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>From among the millions of New York's
poor, can we pick out the Negroes in their
tenements? This is not so difficult a task
as it would have proved fifty years ago when
the colored were scattered throughout the
city; today we find them confined to fairly
definite quarters. A black face on the lower
East Side is viewed with astonishment, while
on the middle West Side it is no more
noticeable than it would be in Atlanta or
New Orleans. Roughly we may count five
Negro neighborhoods in Manhattan: Greenwich
Village, the middle West Side, San
Juan Hill, the upper East, and the upper
West sides. Brooklyn has a large Negro
population, but it is more widely distributed
and less easily located than that of
Manhattan.</p>

<p>Of the five Manhattan neighborhoods the
oldest is Greenwich Village, according to
Janvier once the most attractive part of
New York, where the streets "have a tendency
to sidle away from each other and to
take sudden and unreasonable turns." Here
one finds such fascinating names as Minetta
Lane and Carmine and Cornelia Streets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
These and neighboring thoroughfares grow
daily more grimy, however, and no longer
merit Janvier's praise for cleanliness, moral
and physical. The picturesque, friendly old
houses are giving way to factories with high,
monotonous fronts, where foreigners work
who crowd the ward and destroy its former
American aspect.</p>

<p>Among the old time aristocracy bearing
Knickerbocker names there are a few colored
people who delight in talking of the fine
families and past wealth of old Greenwich
Village. Scornful of the gibberish-speaking
Italians, they sigh, too, at their own race as
they see it, for the ambitious Negro has
moved uptown, leaving this section largely
to widowed and deserted women and degenerates.
The once handsome houses, altered
to accommodate many families, are rotten
and unwholesome, while the newer tenements
of West Third Street are darkened by the
elevated road, and shelter vice that knows
no race. Altogether, this is not a neighborhood
to attract the new-comer. Here alone
in New York I have found the majority of
the adults northern born, men and women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
who, unsuccessful in their struggle with city
life, have been left behind in these old forgotten
streets.<a name="FNanchor_18_3" id="FNanchor_18_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The second section, north of the first, lies
between West Fourteenth and West Fifty-ninth
Streets, and Sixth Avenue and the
Hudson River. In 1880 this was the centre
of the Negro population, but business has
entered some of the streets, the Pennsylvania
Railroad has scooped out acres for its
terminal, and while the colored houses do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
not diminish in number, they show no decided
increase. No one street is given over
to the Negro, but a row of two or three or
six or even eight tenements shelter the black
man. The shelter afforded is poorer than
that given the white resident whose dwelling
touches the black, the rents are a little
higher, and the landlord fails to pay attention
to ragged paper, or to a ceiling which
scatters plaster flakes upon the floor. In
the Thirties there are rear tenements reached
by narrow alley-ways. Crimes are committed
by black neighbor against black
neighbor, and the entrance to the rear yard
offers a tempting place for a girl to linger at
night. A rear tenement is New York's only
approach to the alley of cities farther south.</p>

<p>There are startling and happy surprises in
all tenement neighborhoods, and I recall
turning one afternoon from a dark yard
into a large beautiful room. Muslin curtains
concealed the windows, the brass bed
was covered with a thick white counterpane,
and on either side of the fireplace, where
coal burned brightly in an open grate, were
two rare engravings. It was a workroom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and the mistress of the house, steady, capable,
and very black, was at her ironing-board.
By her sat the colored mammy of the story
book rocking lazily in her chair. She explained
to me that her daughter had found
her down south, two years ago, and brought
her to this northern home, where she had
nothing to do, for her daughter could make
fifty dollars a month. This home picture
was made lastingly memorable by the younger
woman's telling me softly as she went with
me to the door, "I was sold from my mother,
down in Georgia, when I was two years old.
I ain't sure she's my mother. <i>She</i> thinks so;
but I can't ever be sure."</p>

<p>Homes beautiful both in appearance and
in spirit can rarely occur where people must
dwell in great poverty, but there are many
efforts at attractive family life on these
streets. A few of the blocks are orderly
and quiet. Thirty-seventh Street, between
Eighth and Ninth Avenues, is largely given
over to the colored and is rough and noisy.
Here and down by the river at Hell's Kitchen
the rioting in 1900 between the Irish and the
Negro took place. Men are ready for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
fight today, and the children see much of
hard drinking and quick blows.</p>

<p>"The poorer the family, the lower is the
quarter in which it must live, and the more
enviable appears the fortune of the anti-social
class."<a name="FNanchor_19_4" id="FNanchor_19_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> A vicious world dwells in
these streets and makes notorious this section
of New York. For this is a part of the
Tenderloin district, and at night, after the
children's cries have ceased, and the fathers
and mothers who have worked hard during
the day have put out their lights, the automobiles
rush swiftly past, bearing the men
of the "superior race." Temptation is continuous,
and the child that grows up pure
in thought and deed does so in spite of his
surroundings.</p>

<p>Before reaching West Fifty-ninth Street,
the beginning of our third district, we come
upon a Negro block at West Fifty-third
Street. When years ago the elevated railroad
was erected on this fashionable street,
white people began to sell out and rent to
Negroes; and today you find here three
colored hotels, the colored Young Men's and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Young Women's Christian Associations, the
offices of many colored doctors and lawyers,
and three large beautiful colored churches.
The din of the elevated drowns alike the
doctor's voice and his patient's, the client's
and the preacher's.</p>

<p>From Fifty-ninth Street, walking north on
Tenth Avenue, we begin to ascend a hill
that grows in steepness until we reach Sixty-second
Street. The avenue is lined with
small stores kept by Italians and Germans,
but to the left the streets, sloping rapidly to
the Hudson River, are filled with tenements,
huge double deckers, built to within ten feet
of the rear of the twenty-five foot lot, accommodating
four families on each of the five
floors. We can count four hundred and
seventy-nine homes on one side of the street
alone!</p>

<p>This is our third district, San Juan Hill, so
called by an on-looker who saw the policemen
charging up during one of the once
common race fights. It is a bit of Africa, as
Negroid in aspect as any district you are
likely to visit in the South. A large majority
of its residents are Southerners and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
West Indians, and it presents an interesting
study of the Negro poor in a large northern
city. The block on Sixtieth Street has some
white residents, but the blocks on Sixty-first,
Sixty-second, and Sixty-third are given
over entirely to colored. On the square
made by the north side of Sixty-first, the
south side of Sixty-second Streets, and Tenth
and West End Avenues, 5.4 acres, the state
census of 1905 showed 6173 inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_20_5" id="FNanchor_20_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
All but a few of these must have been Negroes,
as the avenue sides of the block, occupied
by whites, are short and with low houses.
It is the long line of five-story tenements,
running eight hundred feet down the two
streets, that brings up the enumeration.
The dwellings on Sixty-first and Sixty-second
Streets are human hives, honeycombed with
little rooms thick with human beings. Bedrooms
open into air shafts that admit no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
fresh breezes, only foul air carrying too often
the germs of disease.</p>

<p>The people on the hill are known for their
rough behavior, their readiness to fight, their
coarse talk. Vice is abroad, not in insidious
form as in the more well-to-do neighborhood
farther north, but open and cheap. Boys
play at craps unmolested, gambling is prevalent,
and Negro loafers hang about the street
corners and largely support the Tenth Avenue
saloons.</p>

<p>But San Juan Hill has many respectable
families, and within the past five years it has
taken a decided turn for the better. The
improvement has been chiefly upon Sixty-third
Street where two model tenements, one
holding one hundred, the other one hundred
and sixty-one families, have been opened
under the management of the City and
Suburban Homes Company, the larger one
having been erected by Mr. Henry Phipps.
Planning for a four per cent return on their
investment, these landlords have rented only
to respectable families, and their rule has
changed the character of the block.<a name="FNanchor_21_6" id="FNanchor_21_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
houses have been remodelled to compete with
the newer dwellings, street rows have ceased,
and the police captain of the district, we are
told, now counts this as one of the peaceful
and law-abiding blocks of the city. When
its other blocks show a like improvement,
San Juan Hill will no longer merit its belligerent
name.</p>

<p>The lower East Side of Manhattan, a many-storied
mass of tenements and workshops,
where immigrants labor and sleep in their
tiny crowded rooms, was once a fashionable
American district. At that time Negroes
dwelt near the whites as barbers, caterers,
and coachmen, as laundresses and waiting-maids.
But with the removal of the people
whom they served, the colored men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
women left also, and it is difficult to find an
African face among the hundreds of thousands
of Europeans south of Fourteenth
Street. On Pell Street, in the Chinese quarter,
there used to be two colored families on
friendly terms with their neighbors, who,
however, went uptown for their pleasures
and their church.</p>

<p>It is not until we reach Third Avenue and
Forty-third Street that we come to the East
Side Negro tenement. From this point,
such houses run, a straggling line, chiefly
between Second and Third Avenues, to the
Bronx where the more well-to-do among the
colored live. At Ninety-seventh Street, and
on up to One Hundredth Street, dark faces
are numerous. About six hundred and fifty
Negro families live on these four streets and
around the corner on Third Avenue. Occasionally
they live in houses occupied by
Jews or Italians. Above this section there
are a number of Negro tenements in the One
Hundred and Thirties, between Madison
and Fifth Avenues&mdash;almost a West Side
neighborhood, since it adjoins the large
colored quarter to the west of Fifth Avenue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
On the whole, the East Side is not often
sought by the colored as a place of residence.
Their important churches are in another part
of the city, and every New Yorker knows the
difficulty in making a way across Central
Park. Yet, the neighborhood is not uncivil
to them, and one rarely reads here of race
friction. Doubtless this is in part owing to
the smallness of the population, all of Manhattan
east of Fifth Avenue containing but
fourteen per cent of the apartments occupied
by colored in the city; but it is partly, too,
that Jews and Italians prove less belligerent
tenement neighbors than Irish.</p>

<p>Five years ago, those of us who were interested
in the Negro poor continually heard of
their difficulty in securing a place to live.
Not only were they unable to rent in neighborhoods
suitable for respectable men and
women, but dispossession, caused perhaps by
the inroad of business, meant a despairing
hunt for any home at all. People clung to
miserable dwellings, where no improvements
had been made for years, thankful to have a
roof to shelter them. Yet all the time new-law
tenements were being built, and Gentile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and Jew were leaving their former apartments
in haste to get into these more attractive
dwellings. At length the Negro got his
chance; not a very good one, but something
better than New York had yet offered him&mdash;a
chance to follow into the houses left
vacant by the white tenants. Owing in part
to the energy of Negro real estate agents, in
part to rapid building operations, desirable
streets, near the subway and the elevated
railroad, were thrown open to the colored.
This Negro quarter, the last we have to note
and the newest, has been created in the past
eight years. When the Tenement House
Department tabulated the 1900 census figures
for the Borough of Manhattan, and
showed the nationalities and races on each
block, it found only 300 colored families in
a neighborhood that today accommodates
4473 colored families.<a name="FNanchor_22_7" id="FNanchor_22_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This large increase
is on six streets, West Ninety-ninth, between
Eighth and Ninth Avenues, West One Hundred
and Nineteenth, between Seventh and
Eighth Avenues, and West One Hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Thirty-third to One Hundred and Thirty-sixth
Streets, between Fifth and Seventh
Avenues, with a few houses between Seventh
and Eighth, and on Lenox Avenues. There
are colored tenements north and south of
this; and while these figures are correct
today,<a name="FNanchor_23_8" id="FNanchor_23_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> they may be wrong tomorrow, for
new tenements are continually given over to
the Negro people. Moreover, on all of these
streets are colored boarding and lodging
houses, crowded with humanity. Houses
today fall into the hands of the Negro as a
child's blocks, placed on end, tumble when
a push is given to the first in the line. The
New York <i>Times</i>, in August, 1905, gives a
graphic account of the entrance of the
colored tenant on West Ninety-ninth Street.
Two houses had been opened for a short time
to Negroes when the other house-owners
capitulated, and the colored influx came:
"The street was so choked with vehicles
Saturday that some of the drivers had to
wait with their teams around the corners for
an opportunity to get into it. A constant
stream of furniture trucks loaded with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
household effects of a new colony of colored
people who are invading the choice locality
is pouring into the street. Another equally
long procession, moving in the other direction,
is carrying away the household goods
of the whites from their homes of years."
The movement is not always so swift as this,
but it is continuous.</p>

<p>This last colored neighborhood perhaps
ought not to be spoken of as belonging to the
poor; not to Lanier's poor whose door pressed
so tighteningly inward. Here are homes
where it is possible, with sufficient money,
to live in privacy, and with the comforts of
steam heat and a private bath. But rents
are high, and if money is scarce, the apartment
must be crowded and privacy lost.
Moreover, vice has made its way into these
newly acquired streets. The sporting class
will always pay more and demand fewer
improvements than the workers, and, unable
to protect himself, the respectable tenant
finds his children forced to live in close
propinquity to viciousness. Each of these
new streets has this objectionable element in
its population, for while some agents make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
earnest efforts to keep the property they
handle respectable, they find the owner wants
money more than respectability.</p>

<p>In our walk up and down Manhattan,
turning aside and searching for Negro-tenanted
streets, we ought to see one thing
with clearness&mdash;that the majority of the
colored population live on a comparatively
few blocks. This is a new and important
feature of their New York life, and in certain
parts of the city it develops a color problem,
for while you seem an inappreciable quantity
when you constitute two per cent of the
population in the borough, you are of importance
when you form one hundred per cent
of the population of your street. This congestion
is accompanied by a segregation of
the race. The dwellers in these tenements
are largely new-comers, men and women
from the South and the West Indies,<a name="FNanchor_24_9" id="FNanchor_24_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> seeking
the North for greater freedom and
for economic opportunity. Like any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
strangers they are glad to make their home
among familiar faces, and they settle in the
already crowded places on the West Side.
Freedom to live on the East Side next door
to a Bohemian family may be very well, but
sociability is better. The housewife who timidly
hangs her clothes on the roof her first
Monday morning in New York is pleased
to find the next line swinging with the laundry
of a Richmond acquaintance, who instructs
her in the perplexing housekeeping
devices of her flat. No chattering foreigner
could do that. And while to be welcome in
a white church is inspiring, to find the girl
you knew at home, in the next pew to you, is
still more delightful when you have arrived,
tired and homesick, at the great city of New
York. So the colored working people, like
the Italians and Jews and other nationalities,
have their quarter in which they live very
much by themselves, paying little attention
to their white neighbors. If the white
people of the city have forced this upon
them, they have easily accepted it. Should
this two per cent of the population be compelled
to distribute itself mathematically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
over the city, each ward and street having its
correct quota, it would evince dissatisfaction.
This is not true of the well-to-do
element, but of the mass of the Negro
workers whose homes we have been visiting.
Loving sociability, these new-comers to the
city&mdash;and it is in the most segregated districts
that the greater number of southern
and British born Negroes are found&mdash;keep
to their own streets and live to themselves.
If they occupy all the sidewalk as they talk
over important matters in front of their
church, the outsider passing should recognize
that he is an intruder and take to the curb.
He would leave the sidewalk entirely were
he on Hester Street or Mulberry Bend.
New-comers to New York usually segregate,
and the Negro is no exception.</p>

<p>While congestion and segregation seem
important to us as we look at these colored
quarters, I suspect that the matter most
pertinent to the Negro new-comer is, not
where he will live nor how he will live, but
whether he will be able to live in New York
at all, whether he can meet the landlord's
agent the day he comes to the door. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
New York rents have mounted upwards as
have her tenements. The Phipps model
houses, built especially to benefit the poor,
charge twenty-five dollars a month for four
tiny rooms and bath; and while this is a
little more than the dark old time rooms
would bring, it takes about all of the twenty-five
dollars you make running an elevator, to
get a flat in New York. What wonder that,
once secured, it is overrun with lodgers, or
that, if privacy is maintained, there is not
enough money left to feed and clothe the
growing household. The once familiar song
of the colored comedian still rings true in
New York:</p>

<p>Within the last few years white Americans,
many of whom were formerly ignorant
of their condition, have been taught that
they are possessed of a racial antipathy for
human beings whose color is not their own.
They have a "natural contrariety," "a dislike
that seems constitutional" toward the
dark tint that they see on another's face.
But however well they may have conned
their lesson, it breaks down or is likely to be
forgotten in the presence of a Negro baby;
for a healthy colored baby is a subject, not
for natural contrariety, but for sympathetic
cuddling. They are most engaging new-comers,
these "delicate bronze statuettes,"<a name="FNanchor_25_1" id="FNanchor_25_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
only warm with life, and smiling good will
upon their world.</p>

<p>Not many colored babies are born in New
York, at least not enough to keep pace with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the deaths. The year 1908 saw in all the
boroughs 1973 births as against 2212 deaths
at all ages.<a name="FNanchor_26_2" id="FNanchor_26_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In this same year the colored births for
Manhattan and the Bronx were 1459, and
the deaths under one year of age 424, an
infant mortality rate of 290 to every thousand.<a name="FNanchor_27_3" id="FNanchor_27_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
That is, two babies in every seven
died under one year of age. The white
infant mortality rate was 127.7, a little less
than half that of the colored.</p>

<p>Why should we have in New York this
enormous colored infant death rate? Many
physicians believe it indicates a lack of
physical stamina in the Negro, an inability
to resist disease. This may be so, but before
falling back upon race as an explanation of
high infant mortality, we need to exhaust
other possible causes. We do not question
the vitality of the white race when we read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
that in parts of Russia 500 babies out of
every thousand die within the year; nor do
we believe the people of Fall River, a factory
town in Massachusetts, have an inherent
inability to resist disease, though their
infant mortality rate in 1900 was 260 in
one thousand births. We look in these
latter cases, as we should in the former, to
see if we find those conditions which careful
students of the subject tell us accompany
a high infant death rate.</p>

<p>Among the first of the accepted causes
of infant mortality is the overcrowding of
cities. We have viewed overcrowding as
a usual condition among the Negroes of
New York, and have seen the small, ill-ventilated
bedroom where the baby spends
much of its life. Heat, with its accompanying
growth of bacteria and swift process
of decomposition, is a second cause. New
York's high infant mortality comes in the
summer months when in the poorest quarters
it has been known to reach four hundred
in the thousand.<a name="FNanchor_28_4" id="FNanchor_28_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the hot, crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
tenements, and no place can be so hot as
New York in one of its July record-breaking
weeks, the babies die like flies, and yet
not like flies, for the flies buzz in hundreds
about the little hot faces. Excitement,
late hours, constant restlessness, these, too,
cause infant mortality. On a city block
tenanted by hundreds of men and women
and little children, no hour of the night is
free from some disturbance. Children whimper
as they wake from the heat, babies cry
shrilly, and the brightly-lighted streets are
rarely without the sound of human footsteps.
The sensitive new-born organism
knows nothing of the quiet and restful darkness
of nature's night.</p>

<p>But the most important cause of infant
mortality<a name="FNanchor_29_5" id="FNanchor_29_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is improper infant feeding. And
here we meet with a condition that confronts
the Negro babies of New York far more
than it confronts the white. For a properly
fed baby is a breast fed baby, or else one
whose food has been prepared with great
care, and mothers forced by necessity to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
out to work, cannot themselves give their
babies this proper food. It is among the
infants of mothers at work that mortality is
high. Mr. G. Newman, an English authority
on this subject, gives an interesting example
of this in Lancashire, where, during
the American civil war, many of the cotton
operatives were out of employment and
many more worked only half time. Privation
was great. A quarter of the mill hands
were in receipt of poor relief, the general
death rate increased, but <i>the infant mortality
rate decreased</i>. The mothers, forced by circumstances
to remain away from the factory,
though in a state of semi-starvation, by
their nursing and by their care of the home
preserved the lives of their infants. Negro
mothers, owing to the low wage earned by
their husbands, for the general welfare of the
family and to avoid semi-starvation, like the
Lancashire women, leave their homes, but
they thereby sacrifice the lives of many of
their babies. The percentage for 1900 of
Negro married women in New York engaging
in self-supporting work was 31.4 in every
hundred; of white married women 4.2 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
every hundred, seven times as many in proportion
among the Negroes as among the
whites.<a name="FNanchor_30_6" id="FNanchor_30_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The Negro also shows a large percentage
of widows, a quarter of all the female
population over ten years of age. Some of
these, we have no means of knowing how
many, are widows only in name, and have
babies for whom they must in some way provide
support. The colored mother who has
no husband often takes a position in domestic
service and boards her baby, paying usually
by the month, and finding the opportunity
to visit her infant perhaps once a week.
Sometimes she secures a "baby tender" who
can give kindly, intelligent care; but under
the best conditions her child will be bottle
fed and in tenement surroundings inimical
to health, while sometimes the woman to
whom she intrusts her infant will be ignorant
of the simplest matters of hygiene.</p>

<p>I remember an old colored woman, she
must be dead by this time, who kept a baby
farm. Her health was poor, and when I
saw her, she had taken to her bed and lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
in a dark room with two infants at her side.
They were indescribably puny, with sunken
cheeks and skinny arms and hands, weighing
what a normal child should weigh at
birth, and yet six and seven months old.
The woman talked to me enthusiastically
of salvation and gave filthy bottles to her
charges. She was exceptionally incompetent,
but there are others doing her work,
too old or too ignorant properly to attend
to the babies under their care.</p>

<p>Mothers who go out to day's-work are
also unable to nurse their babies or to prepare
all their food. The infant is placed
in the care of some neighbor or of a growing
daughter, who may be the impatient "little
mother" of a number of charges. When the
hot summer comes, such a baby is likely to
fall the victim of epidemic diarrh&oelig;a, caused
by pollution of the milk. Newman has a
striking chart of infant death rates in Paris
in which he pictures a rate mounting in
one week as high as 256 in the thousand
among the artificially fed infants, while for
the same week, among the breast fed babies,
the mortality is 32. The Negro mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
seeking self-support by keeping clean another's
house or caring for another's children,
finds her own offspring swiftly taken
from her by a disease that only her nourishing
care could forestall.<a name="FNanchor_31_7" id="FNanchor_31_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Remedial measures have for some time
been taken in New York to check infant
mortality, and they have met with some
success. The distribution of pasteurized
milk by Mr. Nathan Straus, the establishment
of milk stations during the summer
months in New York and Brooklyn where
mothers at slight cost may secure proper
infant food, and where much educative
work is done by the visiting nurse, the multiplication
of day nurseries, all these have
helped to decrease the death rate. The
Negroes have been benefited by these remedial
agencies, but their percentage of 290
is still a matter for grave attention.</p>

<p>Two out of seven of New York's Negro
babies die in the first year, but the other
five grow up, some with puny arms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
ricketty legs, others again too hardy for
bad food or bad air to harm.</p>

<p>Like the babies these children suffer from
their mother's absence at work. Family
ties are loose, and more than other children
they are handicapped by lack of proper
home care. In an examination of the records
of the Children's Court for three years
I found that out of 717 arraignments of
colored children, 221 were for improper
guardianship, 30.8 per cent of the whole.
Among the Russian children of the East
Side, Tenth and Eleventh Wards, only
15 per cent of arraignments were on this
complaint, indicating twice as many children
without parental care among the colored
as among the children of the Tenth and
Eleventh Wards. Rough colored girls, also,
whose habits were too depraved to permit of
their remaining without restraint, were frequently
committed to reformatories.</p>

<p>Truancy is not uncommon in colored
neighborhoods, though few cases come before
the courts. Sometimes the boy or girl is
kept at home to care for the younger children,
but again, lacking the mother's over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>sight,
he remains on the street when he
should be in school, or arrives late with ill
prepared lessons.</p>

<p>Asking a teacher of long experience among
colored and white children concerning their
respective scholarship, he assured me that
the colored child could do as well as the
white, but didn't. "From 20 to 50 per
cent of the mothers of my colored children,"
he said, "go out to work. There is
no one to oversee the child's tasks, and
consequently little conscientious study."</p>

<p>One can scarcely blame the children; and
certainly one cannot blame the mothers for
toiling for their support. And the fathers,
though they work faithfully, are rarely
able to earn enough unaided to support their
families. Perhaps in time the city may improve
matters by opening its school-rooms
for a study period in the afternoon.</p>

<p>But meanwhile the children are without
proper care. This is not hard to endure in
the summer, but in winter it is very trying
to be without a home. Poor little cold
boys and girls, some of them mere babies!
You see them in the late afternoon sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
on the tenement stairs, waiting for the long
day to be done. It seems a week since
they were inside eating their breakfast.
The city has not pauperized them with a
luncheon, and they have had only cold food
since morning. Sometimes they have been
all day without nourishment. When the
door is opened at last, there are many helpful
things for them to do for their mother,
and reading and arithmetic are relegated
to so late an hour that their problem is
only temporarily solved by sleep.</p>

<p>Not all the colored working women, however,
go out for employment. Laundry
work is an important home industry, and
one may watch many mothers at their
tubs or ironing-boards from Monday morning
until Saturday night. This makes the
tenement rooms, tiny enough at best, sadly
cluttered, but it does not deprive the children
of the presence of their mother, who
accepts a smaller income to remain at home
with them. For after we have made full
allowance for the lessening of family ties
among the Negroes by social and economic
pressure, we find that the majority of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
colored boys and girls receive a due share
of proper parental oversight. They are
fed on appetizing food, cleanly and prettily
dressed, they are encouraged to study
and to improve their position, and they
are given all the advantages that it is possible
for their mothers and fathers to
secure.</p>

<p>Jack London tells in the "Children of
the Abyss" of the East Side of London,
where "they have dens and lairs into which
to crawl for sleeping purposes, and that is
all. One can not travesty the word by
calling such dens and lairs 'homes.'" I
have seen thousands of Negro dwelling-places,
but I cannot think of half a dozen,
however great their poverty, where this
description would be correct. No matter
how dingy the tenement, or how long the
hours of work, the mother, and the father,
too, try to make the "four walls and a
ceiling" to which they return, home. Visitors
among the New York poor, in the past
and in the present, testify that given the
same income or lack of income, the colored
do not allow their surroundings to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
so cheerless or so filthy as the white, and
that when there is an opportunity for the
mother to spend some time in the house,
the rooms take on an air of pleasant refinement.
Pictures decorate the walls, the sideboard
contains many pretty dishes, and the
table is set three times a day. Meals are not
eaten out of the paper bag common on New
York's East Side, but there is something of
formality about the dinner, and good table
manners are taught the children. The tenement
dwelling becomes a home, and the
boys and girls pass a happy childhood in
it.</p>

<p>Watching the colored children for many
months in their play and work, I have
looked for possible distinctive traits. The
second generation of New Yorkers greatly
resembles the "Young America" of all nationalities
of the city, shrill-voiced, disrespectful,
easily diverted, whether at work
or at play, shrewd, alert, and mischievous&mdash;the
New York street child. I remember
once helping with a club of eight boys where
seven nationalities were represented, and
where no one could have distinguished Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
from German or Jew from Italian, with his
eyes shut. Had a Negro been brought up
among them he would quickly have taken
on their ways. Of the colored children who
model their lives after their mischievous
young white neighbors, many outdo the
whites in depravity and lawlessness; but
among the boys and girls who live by themselves,
as on San Juan Hill, one sees occasional
interesting traits.</p>

<p>The records of the Children's Court of
New York (Boroughs of Manhattan and
the Bronx) throw a little light on this matter,
and are sufficiently important to quote
with some fulness. For the three years
studied, 1904, 1905, 1906, I tabulated the
cases of the colored children brought before
the court, and also the cases of the children
of the Tenth and Eleventh Wards, chiefly
Hungarians and Russian Jews, expecting to
find, in two such dissimilar groups, interesting
comparisons. The following table
shows the result of this study. The court
in its annual report gives the figures for the
total number of arrests which I have incorporated
in my table:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p>Our table shows us that which we have
already noted, the high percentage of improper
guardianship among the Negroes and
the grave number of depraved Negro girls.
For the sins of petit larceny, grand larceny,
and burglary, putting the three together,
the colored child shows a slightly smaller
percentage than the East Side white, a
noticeably smaller percentage than the total
number of children. The sin of theft is
often swiftly attributed to a black face, but
this percentage indicates that the colored
child has no "innate tendency" to steal.
Ten per cent of the arrests among the East
Side children are for unlicensed peddling
and violation of the labor law, but no little
Negro boys plunge into the business world
before their time. They have no keen commercial
sense to lead them to undertake
transactions on their own account, and they
are not desired by purchasers of boy labor
in the city.</p>

<p>The most important heading, numerically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
is that of mischief, and here the Negro falls
far behind the Eastsider, behind the average
for the whole. While depravity among
the girls and improper guardianship are the
race's most serious defects, as shown by the
arrests among its children in New York,
tractability and a decent regard for law are
among its merits. The colored child, especially
if he is in a segregated neighborhood,
is not greatly inclined to mischief. My own
experience has shown me that life in a tenement
on San Juan Hill is devoid of the ingenious,
exasperating deviltry of an Irish or
German-American neighborhood. No daily
summons calls one to the door only to hear
wildly scurrying footsteps on the stairs.
Mail boxes are left solely for the postman's
use, and hallways are not defaced by obscene
writing. There is plenty of crap shooting,
rarely interfered with by the police, but there
is little impertinent annoyance or destructiveness.</p>

<p>An observer, watching the little colored
boys and girls as they play on the city streets,
finds much that is attractive and pleasant.
They sing their songs, learned at school and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
on the playground, fly their kites, spin their
tops, run their races. They usually finish
what they begin, not turning at the first
interruption to take up something else.
They move more deliberately than most
children, and their voices are slower to adopt
the New York screech than those of their
Irish neighbors on the block above them.
Altogether they are attractive children,
particularly the smaller ones, who are more
energetic than their big brothers and sisters.
Good manners are often evident.
While receiving an afternoon call from two
girls, aged four and five, I was invited by
the older to partake of half a peanut, the
other half of which she split in two and generously
shared with her companion. "Gim'me
five cents," I once heard a Negro boy of
twelve say to his mother who walked past
him on the street. She did not seem to
hear, but the boy's companion, a youth of
the same age, reproved him severely for
his rude speech. When walking with an
Irish friend, who had worked among the
children of her own race, I saw a colored
boy run swiftly up the block to meet his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
mother. He kissed her, took her bundle
from her, and carrying it under his arm,
walked quietly by her side to their home.
"There are many boys here," I said, "who
are just as courteous as that." "Is that
so?" she retorted quickly, "Then you
needn't be explaining to me any further
the reason for the high death rate."</p>

<p>The gentle, chivalrous affection of the
child for its mother is daily to be seen among
these boys and girls. "Your African," said
Mary Kingsley, "is little better than a
slave to his mother, whom he loves with a
love he gives to none other. This love of
his mother is so dominant a factor in his
life that it must be taken into consideration
in attempting to understand the true
Negro."<a name="FNanchor_33_9" id="FNanchor_33_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And if the child lavishes affection
upon its parent, the mother in turn
gives untiringly to her child. She is the
"mammy" of whom we have so often heard,
but with her loving care bestowed, as it
should be, upon her own offspring. She
tries to keep her child clean in body and spirit
and to train it to be gentle and good; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
in return usually she receives a stanch
devotion. I once found fault with a colored
girl of ten years for her rude behavior
with her girl companions, adding that perhaps
she did not know any better, at which
she turned on me almost fiercely and said,
"It's our fault; we know better. Our
mothers learn us. It's we that's bold."
As one watches the boys and girls walking
quietly up the street of a Sunday afternoon
to their Sunday-school, neatly and cleanly
dressed, one appreciates the anxious, maternal
care that strives as best it knows how,
to rear honest and God-fearing men and
women.</p>

<p>Paul Lawrence Dunbar has painted the
Negro father, his "little brown baby wif
sparklin' eyes," nestling close in his arms.
Working at unusual hours, the colored man
often has a part of the day to give to his
family, and one sees him wheeling the baby
in its carriage, or playing with the older
boys and girls.</p>

<p>Negroes seem naturally a gentle, loving
people. As you live with them and watch
them in their homes, you find some coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>ness,
but little real brutality. Rarely does
a father or mother strike a child. Travellers
in Central and West Africa describe
them as the most friendly of savage folk,
and where, as in our city, they live largely
to themselves, they keep something of these
characteristics. But it is only a step in
New York from Africa into Italy or Ireland;
and the step may bring a sad jostling to
native friendliness. To hold his own with
his white companions on the street or in
school, the Negro must become pugnacious,
callous to insult, ready to hit back when
affronted. Many are like the little girl who
told me that she did not care to play with
white children, "because," she explained,
"my mother tells me to smack any one
who calls me nigger, and I ain't looking for
trouble." The colored children aren't looking
for trouble. They have a tendency to
run away from it if they see it in the form of
a gang of boys coming to them around the
corner. They believe if they had a fight, it
wouldn't be a fair one, and that if the policeman
came, he would arrest them and not
their Irish enemies. So they grow up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
streets through which few white men pass,
leading their own lives with their own people
and thinking not overmuch of the other race
that surrounds them. But the day comes
when school is over, and the outside world,
however indifferent they may be to it, must
be met. They must go out and grapple
with it for the means to hire a cooking
stove and a dark bedroom of their own; they
must think of making money. So they stand
at the corner of their street, looking out,
and then move slowly on to find what opportunity
is theirs to come to a full manhood.
The way ahead does not seem very bright,
and some move so timidly that failure is
sure to meet them at the first turning. But
some have the courage of the little colored
girl, aged four, who led a line of kindergarten
children up their street and then on
to the unknown country that lay between
them and Central Park. At the first block
a mob of Irish boys fell upon them, running
between the lines, throwing sticks, and
calling "nigger" with screams and jeers.
The leader held her head high, paying no
attention to her persecutors. She neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
quickened nor slowed her pace, and when
the child at her side fell back, she pulled her
hand and said, "Don't notice them. Walk
straight ahead."</p>

<span class="smcap">Earning a Living&mdash;Manual Labor and
the Trades</span></h2>


<p>In "The American Race Problem," one of
our recent important books upon the Negro,
the author, Mr. Alfred Holt Stone of Mississippi,
after a survey of the world, declares
that "to me, it seems the plainest fact confronting
the Negro is that there is but one
area of any size wherein his race may obey
the command to eat its bread in the sweat of
its face side by side with the white man.
That area is composed of the Southern
United States."<a name="FNanchor_34_1" id="FNanchor_34_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>On examination we find that only men of
English and North European stock are
"white" to Mr. Stone, and that his statement
is too sweeping by a continent or two,
but as applying to the United States, it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
usually meet with unqualified approval. It
is generally believed that discrimination continually
retards the Negro in his search for
employment in the North, while in the South
"he is given a man's chance in the commercial
world." Northern men visiting southern
colored industrial schools advise the pupils
to remain where they are, and restless spirits
among the race are assured that it is better
to submit to some personal oppression than
to go to a land of uncertain employment.
The past glory of the North is dwelt upon,
its days of black waiters, and barbers, and
coachmen, but the present is painted in
harsh colors.</p>

<p>There is some truth in this comparison of
economic conditions among the Negroes in
the North and in the South, but it must not
be taken too literally. Today's tendency
to minimize southern and maximize northern
race difficulties, while strengthening the
bonds between white Americans, sometimes
obscures the real issues regarding colored
labor in this country. We need to look carefully
at conditions in numbers of selected
localities, and we can find no northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
city more worthy of our study than New
York.</p>

<p>The New York Negro constitutes today
but two per cent of the population of Manhattan,
one and eight-tenths per cent of that
of Greater New York; and, as many workers
in Manhattan live in Brooklyn, the larger
area is the better one to consider. In 1900,
the census volume on occupations gives the
number of males over ten years of age engaged
in gainful occupations in Greater New
York at 1,102,471, and of that number
20,395 or 1.8 per cent, eighteen in every
thousand, are Negroes. In Atlanta, to take
a southern commercial centre, 351 out of
every thousand male workers are Negroes.
This enormous difference in the proportion
of colored workers to white must never be
forgotten in considering the labor situation
North and South. We cannot expect in the
North to see the Negro monopolizing an
industry which demands a larger share of
workers than he can produce, nor need we
admit that he has lost an occupation when
he does not control it.</p>

<p>We often come upon such a statement as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
that of Samuel R. Scottron, a colored business
man, who, writing in 1905, said, "The
Italian, Sicilian, Greek, occupy quite every
industry that was confessedly the Negro's
forty years ago. They have the bootblack
stands, the news stands, barbers' shops,
waiters' situations, restaurants, janitorships,
catering business, stevedoring, steamboat
work, and other situations occupied by
Negroes."<a name="FNanchor_35_2" id="FNanchor_35_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Did the colored men have all
this forty years ago when they were only one
and a half per cent of the population? If
so, there were giants in those days, or New
York was much simpler in its habits than
now. At present the control by the colored
people of any such an array of industries
would be quite impossible. To take four
out of the nine occupations enumerated: the
census of 1900 gives the number of waiters
at 31,211; barbers, 12,022; janitors, 6184;
bootblacks, 2648; a total of 52,065. But in
1900 there were only 20,395 Negro males
engaged in gainful occupations in New York.
Without a vigorous astral body the 20,000-odd
colored men could not occupy half these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
jobs. If they dominated in the field of
waiters they must abandon handling the
razor, and not all the colored boys could
muster 2684 strong to black the boots of
Greater New York. We must at the outset
recognize that as a labor factor the Negro in
New York is insignificant.</p>

<p>The volume of the federal census for 1900
on occupations shows us how the Negroes
are employed in New York City. There are
five occupational divisions, and the Negroes
and whites are divided among them as
follows:</p>

<p>But in examining in detail the occupations
under these different headings, we get a
clearer view of the place the Negro maintains
as a laborer by finding out how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
workers he supplies to every thousand workers
in a given occupation. He should average
eighteen if he is to occupy the same economic
status as the white man. Taking the first
(numerically) important division, Domestic
and Personal Service, we get the following

<p>The most important of these groups, not
only in absolute numbers, but in proportion
to the whole working population, is the
servants and waiters. Two hundred out of
every thousand (we must remember that the
proportion to the population would be eighteen
out of every thousand) are holding
positions with which they have long been
identified in America. We cannot tell from
the census how many "live out," or how
many are able to go nightly to their homes,
how many have good jobs, and how many
are in second and third rate places. A
study of my own of 716 colored men helps
to answer one of these questions. Out of
176 men coming under the servants' and
waiters' classification, I found 5 caterers,
24 cooks, 26 butlers, 30 general utility men,
41 hotel men, and 50 waiters. Sixty per
cent of the 176 lived in their own homes, not
in their masters'. Some of the cooks and
waiters were on Pullman trains or on river
boats or steamers; only a few were in first-class
positions in New York. In the summer
many of these men are likely to go to country
hotels, and with the winter, if New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
offers nothing, migrate to Palm Beach or
stand on the street corner while their wives
go out to wash and scrub.<a name="FNanchor_36_3" id="FNanchor_36_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "An' it don't
do fer me ter complain," one of them tells
me, "else he gits 'high' an' goes off fer good."
Waiters in restaurants sometimes do not
make more than six dollars a week, to be
supplemented by tips, bringing the sum up
to nine or ten dollars. Hall men make about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the same, but both waiters and hall men in
clubs and hotels receive large sums in tips
or in Christmas money. The Pullman car
waiters have small wages but large fees.</p>

<p>Looking again at the census, we see that
129 out of every thousand janitors and
sextons are colored. The janitor's position
varies from the impecunious place in a tenement,
where the only wage is the rent, to the
charge of a large office or apartment building.
Then come the laborers, nearly four thousand
strong, with the elevator boy as a familiar
figure. Forty per cent of the 139 laborers in
my own tabulation were elevator boys, for,
except in office buildings and large stores
and hotels, this occupation is given over to
the Negro, who spends twelve hours a day
drowsing in a corner or standing to turn a
wheel. Paul Lawrence Dunbar wrote poetry
while he ran an elevator, and ambitious if
less talented colored boys today study civil
service examinations in their unoccupied
time; but the situation as a life job is not
alluring. Twenty-five dollars a month for
wage, with perhaps a half this sum in tips,
twelve hours on duty, one week in the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
time and the next in the day&mdash;no wonder
the personnel of this staff changes frequently
in an apartment house. A bright boy will
be taken by some business man for a better
job, and a lazy one drifts away to look for
an easier task, or is dismissed by an irate
janitor.</p>

<p>Quite another group of laborers are the
longshoremen who, far from lounging indolently
in a hallway, are straining every
muscle as they heave some great crate into
a ship's hold. The work of the New York
dockers has been admirably described by
Mr. Ernest Poole, who says of the thirty
thousand longshoremen on the wharves of
New York&mdash;Italians, Germans, Negroes,
and Swedes, "Far from being the drunkards
and bums that some people think them, they
are like the men of the lumber camps come
to town&mdash;huge of limb and tough of muscle,
hard-swearing, quick-fisted, big of heart."
Their tasks are heavy and irregular. When
the ship comes in, the average stretch of
work for a gang is from twelve to twenty
hours, and sometimes men go to a second
gang and labor thirty-five hours without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
sleep. Their pay for this dangerous, exhausting
toil averages eleven dollars a week.
"There are thousands of Negroes on the
docks of New York," Mr. Poole writes me,
"and they must be able to work long hours
at a stretch or they would not have their
jobs." At dusk, Brooklynites see these
black, huge-muscled men, many of them
West Indians, walking up the hill at Montague
Street. In New York they live among
the Irish in "Hell's Kitchen" and on San
Juan Hill. They are usually steady supporters
of families.</p>

<p>New York demands strong, unskilled laborers.
To some she pays a large wage,
and Negroes have gone in numbers into the
excavations under the rivers, though a lingering
death may prove the end of their two
and a half or perhaps six or seven dollar a
day job. Many colored men worked in the
subway during its construction. One sees
them often employed at rock-drilling or
clearing land for new buildings. About a
third of the asphalt workers, making their
two dollars and a half a day, are colored.
Some educated, refined Negroes choose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
laborer's work rather than pleasanter but
poorly paid occupations. A highly trained
colored man, a shipping clerk, making seven
dollars a week, left his employer to take a
job of concreting in the subway at $1.80 a
day. His decision was in favor of dirty,
severe labor, but a living wage.</p>

<p>When the next census is published, those
of us who are carefully watching the economic
condition of the Negro expect to find a movement
from domestic service into the positions
of laborers, including the porters in
stores, who belong in our second census
division.</p>

<p>Kelly Miller<a name="FNanchor_37_4" id="FNanchor_37_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> describes the massive buildings
and sky-seeking structures of our northern
city, and finds no status for the Negro
above the cellar floor. One can see the
colored youth gazing wistfully through the
office window at the clerk, whose business
reaches across the ocean to bewilderingly
wonderful continents, knowing as he does
that the employment he may find in that
office will be emptying the white man's waste
paper basket.</p>

<p>This, however, does not apply to government
positions, and a large number of the
423 colored clerks in 1900 were probably in
United States and municipal service. The
latter we shall consider later as we study the
Negro and the municipality. Of the former,
in 1909 there were about 176 in the New
York post-offices.<a name="FNanchor_38_5" id="FNanchor_38_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Ambitious boys work
industriously at civil service examinations,
and a British West Indian will even become
an American citizen for the chance of a congenial
occupation. The clerkship, that to a
white man is only a stepping-stone, to a
Negro is a highly coveted position.</p>

<p>I have made two divisions of this census
list; the first includes those occupations requiring
intellectual skill and carrying with
them some social position, the second, those
demanding only manual work. It is in the
second that the colored man finds a place,
and as a porter he numbers 2143, and reaches
almost as high a percentage as the waiter
and servant. Porters' positions are paid
from five to fifteen dollars a week, the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
receiving the latter wage performing also the
duties of shipping clerk. There is some
opportunity for advance, always within the
basement, and there are regular hours and a
fairly steady job.</p>

<p>The heading of draymen, hackmen, and
teamsters, with 28 colored in every thousand,
shows that the Negro has not lost his place
as a driver. The chauffeur does not appear
in the census, but the Negro is steadily
increasing in numbers in this occupation, and
conducts three garages of his own.</p>

<p>The last census division to be considered
in this chapter is that of Manufacturing and
Mechanical Pursuits.</p>

<p>When Mr. Stone wrote of the Southern
States as the only place in which the Negro
could "earn his bread in the sweat of his
face," side by side with the white man, he
must especially have been thinking of workers
in the skilled trades. Unskilled laborers
in New York are drenched in a common
grimy fellowship. But in this last division
the Negro is conspicuous by his absence.
Only four in every thousand where there
should be eighteen! In Atlanta, under this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>division, the race reaches almost its due
proportion, 279 in a thousand instead of 351.
The largest number in any trade in New
York is 189 men among the Cuban tobacco
workers. Seventy-five per cent of all the
masons in Atlanta are colored men, while in
New York the colored are less than one
per cent. Looking down the list we see that
the figures are small and the percentage insignificant.
The highly skilled and best paid
trades are seemingly as far removed from
the Negro as the positions of floor-walkers
or cashiers of banks.</p>

<p>Omitting for the present the professional
class, we have reviewed the Negro as a
worker, and neither in wages nor choice of
occupation has he risen far to success. In
domestic service he has gone a little down
the ladder, serving in less desirable positions
than in former years. Why has this happened?
What good reasons are there for
these conditions?</p>

<p>The first and most obvious reason is race
prejudice. No display of talent, however
prodigious, will open certain occupations to
the colored race. As a salesman he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
teach courteous manners to some of our
white salesmen in New York, but he is never
given a chance. There are a few Negroes,
digging in the tunnels or sweeping down the
subway stairs, who are capable of filling the
clerkships that are counted the perquisites
of the whites; but clerkships are only accessible
as they are associated with municipal or
federal service. Of course there are exceptions,
and though they do not affect the rule,
they show the existence of a few employers
who ignore the color line, and a few Negroes
of inexhaustible perseverance.</p>

<p>Mr. Stone argues that the Negro in the
South profits by the strict drawing of the
color line, since the white man, always considered
the superior, is not lowered in the
eyes of the community by working with the
black man. The Southern white may lay
bricks on the same wall with the Southern
black, secure in his superior social position.
But this seems fanciful as an explanation of
labor conditions. The black doctor, for instance,
in those localities where the color
line is most rigid, may not ask the white
doctor to consult with him; or if he does, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
prompt removal from the community is
requested. Colored postal clerks are in disfavor
in the South, though not colored postmen.
North or South, <i>the Negro gets an
opportunity to work where he is imperatively
needed</i>. Constituting one-third of the working
population, he can make a place for himself
in the laboring world of Atlanta as he
cannot in New York. Pick up the 20,000
New York Negroes and drop them in Liberia,
and in two or three weeks Ellis Island could
empty out sufficient men to fill their places;
but remove a third of the male workers from
Atlanta, and the city for years would suffer
from the calamity. If they are the only
available source of labor, colored men can
work by the side of white men; but where
the white man strongly dominates the labor
situation, he tries to push his black brother
into the jobs for which he does not care to
compete.</p>

<p>We have seen, however, that in some occupations
in New York the Negroes appear in
such proportion as should be sufficient to
secure them excellent positions; the most
conspicuous instance being that of the 200<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
colored waiters out of every thousand. Why,
then, do we not see Negroes serving in the
best hotels the city affords?</p>

<p>It has been an ideal of American democracy,
a part of its strenuous individualism,
that each member of the community should
have full liberty in the pursuit of wealth.
The ambitious, capable boy who walks bare-footed
into the city, and at the end of twenty
years has outdistanced his country school-mates,
becoming a multi-millionaire while
they are still farm drudges, is the example of
American opportunity. But this ability to
separate one's self from the rest of one's
fellows and attain individual greatness is
rarely possible to a segregated race. In
domestic service individual colored men have
shown ambition and high capability, but
they have never been able to get away from
their fellows like the country boy&mdash;to leave
the farm drudges and take a place among the
most proficient of their profession. They
must always work in a race group. And this
Negro group is like the small college that
tries to win at football against a competitor
with four times the number of students and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
a better coach. The two hundred colored
waiters, competing against the eight hundred
white ones, lose in the game and are given a
second place, which the best must accept
with the worst. When, then, we criticize a
capable colored man for failing to keep a
superior position we must remember that
he is tied to his group and has little chance
of advancement on his individual merit.</p>

<p>The census division of mechanical pursuits
shows only a few colored men working at
trades, and the paucity of the numbers is often
attributed by the Negro to a third obstacle
in the way of his progress, the trade-union.</p>

<p>To the colored man who has overcome race
prejudice sufficiently to be taken into a shop
with white workmen, the walking delegate
who appears and asks for his union card
seems little short of diabolical; and all the
advantages that collective bargaining has
secured, the higher wage and shorter working-day,
are forgotten by him. I have heard
the most distinguished of Negro educators,
listening to such an incident as this, declare
that he should like to see every labor union
in America destroyed. But unionism has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
come to stay, and the colored man who is
asked for his card had better at once get to
work and endeavor to secure it. Many have
done this already, and organized labor in
New York, its leaders tell us, receives an
increasing number of colored workmen. Miss
Helen Tucker, in a careful study of Negro
craftsmen in the West Sixties,<a name="FNanchor_39_6" id="FNanchor_39_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> found among
121 men who had worked at their trades in
the city, 32, or 26 per cent in organized labor.
The majority of these had joined in New
York. Eight men, out of the 121, had
applied for entrance to unions and not been
admitted. This does not seem a discouraging
number, though we do not know whether
the other 81 could have been organized or
not. Many, probably, were not sufficiently
competent workmen. In 1910, according to
the best information that I could secure,
there were 1358 colored men in the New
York unions. Eighty of these were in the
building trades, 165 were cigar makers, 400
were teamsters, 350 asphalt workers, and
240 rock-drillers and tool sharpeners.<a name="FNanchor_40_7" id="FNanchor_40_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>Entrance to some of the local organizations
is more easily secured than to others,
for the trade-union, while part of a federation,
is autonomous, or nearly so. In some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of the highly skilled trades, to which few
colored men have the necessary ability to
demand access, the Negro is likely to be
refused, while the less intelligent and well-paid
forms of labor press a union card upon
him. Again, strong organizations in the
South, as the bricklayers, send men North
with union membership, who easily transfer
to New York locals. Miss Tucker finds the
carpenters', masons', and plasterers' organizations
easy for the Negro to enter. There
is in New York a colored local, the only
colored local in the city, among a few of the
carpenters, with regular representation in
the Central Federated Union. The American
Federation of Labor in 1881 declared
that "the working people must unite irrespective
of creed, color, sex, nationality, or
politics." This cry is for self-protection, and
where the Negroes have numbers and ability
in a trade, their organization becomes important
to the white. It may be fairly said
of labor organization in New York that it
finds and is at times unable to destroy race
prejudice, but that it does not create it.<a name="FNanchor_41_8" id="FNanchor_41_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<p>A fourth obstacle, and a very important
one, is the lack of opportunity for the colored
boy. The only trade that he can easily learn
is that of stationary engineer, an occupation
at which the Negroes do very well. Colored
boys in small numbers are attending evening
trade schools, but their chance of securing
positions on graduation will be small. The
Negro youth who is not talented enough to
enter a profession, and who cannot get into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the city or government service, has slight
opportunity. Nothing is so discouraging in
the outlook in New York as the crowding
out of colored boys from congenial remunerative
work.</p>

<p>The last obstacle in the way of the Negro's
advancement into higher occupations is his
inefficiency. Race prejudice denies him the
opportunity to prove his ability in many
occupations, and the same spirit forces him
to work in a race group; but the colored men
themselves are often unfitted for any labor
other than that they undertake.</p>

<p>The picture that is sometimes drawn of
many thousands of highly skilled Southern
colored men forced in New York to give up
their trades and to turn to menial labor
is not a correct one. Richard R. Wright,
Jr., who has made a careful study of the
Negro in Philadelphia,<a name="FNanchor_42_9" id="FNanchor_42_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> finds that the majority
of colored men who come to that city
are from the class of unskilled city laborers
and country hands; the minority are the
more skilful artisans and farmers and domes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>tic
servants, with a number also of the
vagrant and criminal classes.</p>

<p>In New York the untrained Negroes not
only form a very large class, but coming in
contact, as they do, with foreigners who for
generations have been forced to severe, unremitting
toil, they suffer by comparison.
The South in the days of slavery demanded
chiefly routine work in the fields from its
Negroes.<a name="FNanchor_43_10" id="FNanchor_43_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The work was under the direction
either of the master, the overseer, or a
foreman; and there has been no general
advance in training for the colored men of
the South since that time. Contrast the
intensive cultivation of Italy or Switzerland
with the farms of Georgia or Alabama, or
the hotels of France with those of Virginia,
and you will see the disadvantages from
which the Negro suffers. America is young
and crude, but opportunity has brought to
her great cities workmen from all over the
world. In New York these men are driven
at a pace that at the outset distracts the
colored man who prefers his leisurely way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Moreover, the foreign workmen have learned
persistence; they are punctual and appear
regularly each morning at their tasks. "The
Italians are better laborers than any other
people we have, are they not?" I asked a
man familiar with many races and nationalities.
"No," was his answer, "they do not
work better than others, but when the
whistle blows, they are always there." Mr.
Stone, whose book I have already quoted a
number of times, shows the irresponsible,
fanciful wanderings of his Mississippi tenants,
whom he endeavored, unsuccessfully, to establish
in a permanent tenantry. The colored
men in New York are far in advance of these
farm hands, who are described as moving
about simply because they desire a change,
but they are also far from the steady, unswerving
attitude of their foreign competitors.
Inadequately educated, too often they
come to New York with little equipment for
tasks they must undertake successfully or
starve&mdash;unless, puerile, they live by the
labor of some industrious woman.</p>

<p>I have tried to depict the New York colored
wage earners as they labor in the city today.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
They are not a remarkable group, and were
they white men, distinguished by some mark
of nationality, they would pass without
comment. But the Negro is on trial, and
witnesses are continually called to tell of
his failures and successes. We have seen
that both in the attitude of the world about
him, and in his own untutored self, there
are many obstacles to prevent his advance;
and his natural sensitiveness adds to these
difficulties. He minds the coarse but often
good-natured joke of his fellow laborer, and
he remembers with a lasting pain the mortification
of an employer's curt refusal of
work. Had he the obtuseness of some
Americans he would prosper better. As we
have seen, many positions are completely
closed to him, leading him to idleness and
consequent crime. Just as not every able-bodied
white man, who is out of work and
impoverished, will go to the charities wood-yard
and saw wood, so not every colored
man will accept the menial labor which may
be the only work open to him. Instead, he
may gamble or drift into a vagabond life.
A well-known Philadelphia judge has said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
that "The moral and intellectual advance
of a race is governed by the degree of its
industrial freedom. When that freedom is
restricted there is unbounded tendency to
drive the race discriminated against into the
ranks of the criminal." Discrimination in
New York has led many Negroes into these
ranks. But as we look back at the occupations
of our colored men we see a large number
who secure regular hours, and if a poor,
yet a fairly steady pay. For the mass of the
Negroes coming into the city these positions
are an advance over their former work.
Employment in a great mercantile establishment,
though it be in the basement, carries
dignity with it, and educating demands of
punctuality, sobriety, and swiftness. Richard
R. Wright, Jr., whose right to speak with
authority we have already noted, believes
that the "North has taught the Negro the
value of money; of economy; it has taught
more sustained effort in work, punctuality,
and regularity." It has also, I believe, in
its more regular hours of work, aided in the
upbuilding of the home.</p>

<p>I remember once waiting in the harbor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Genoa while our ship was taking on a cargo.
The captain walked the deck impatiently,
and, as the Italians went in leisurely fashion
about their task, declared, "If I had those
men in New York I could get twice the
amount of work out of them." That is what
New York does; it works men hard and fast;
sometimes it mars them; but it pays a better
wage than Genoa, and there is an excitement
and dash about it that attracts laborers from
all parts of the earth. The black men come,
insignificant in numbers, ready to do their
part. They work and play and marry and
bring up children, and as we watch them
moving to and from their tasks the North
seems to have brought to the majority of
them something of liberty and happiness.</p>

The large number of bricklayers in 1906 is questioned by
the man, himself a bricklayer, who made the second counting.
However, the number greatly decreased in 1908 when the
stagnation in business compelled many men to seek work in
other cities.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_8" id="Footnote_41_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The comment of the Negro bricklayer who secured my
figures is important. "A Negro," he says, "has to be extra
fit in his trade to retain his membership, as the eyes of all the
other workers are watching every opportunity to disqualify
him, thereby compelling a superefficiency. Yet at all times
he is the last to come and the first to go on the job, necessitating
his seeking other work for a living, and keeping up his
card being but a matter of sentiment. While all the skilled
trades seem willing to accept the Negro with his travelling
card, yet there are some which utterly refuse him; for instance,
the house smiths and bridge men who will not recognize him
at all. While membership in the union is necessary to work,
yet the hardest part of the battle is to secure employment.
In some instances intercession has been made by various
organizations interested in his industrial progress for employment
at the offices of various companies, and favorable
answers are given, but hostile foremen with discretionary
power carry out their instructions in such a manner as to
render his employment of such short duration that he is very
little benefited. Of course, there are some contractors who
are very friendly to a few men, and whenever any work is
done by them, they are certain of employment. Unfortunately,
these are too few."</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<span class="smcap">Earning a Living&mdash;Business and
the Professions</span></h2>


<p>If we walk west on Fifty-ninth Street,
at Eighth Avenue, we come upon one of the
colored business sections of New York.
Here, for a block's length, are employment
and real estate agents, restaurant keepers,
grocers, tailors, barbers, printers, expressmen,
and undertakers, all small establishments
occupying the first floor or basement
of some tenement or lodging house, and with
the exception of the employment agency all
patronized chiefly by the colored race.
Another such section and a more prosperous
one is in Harlem, on West One Hundred
and Thirty-third, One Hundred and Thirty-fourth,
and One Hundred and Thirty-fifth
Streets. From the point of view of the whole
business of the city such concerns are insignificant,
but they are important from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
viewpoint of Negro progress, since they
represent the accumulation of capital, experience
in business methods, and hard
work. Very slowly the New York Negro
is meeting the demanding power of his
people and is securing neighborhood trade
that has formerly gone to the Italian and
the Jew. Husband and wife, father and son,
work in their little establishments and make
a beginning in the mercantile world.</p>

<p>The Negro, as we have seen, has conducted
businesses in New York in the past,
businesses patronized chiefly by whites.
Barbering and catering were his successes,
and in both of these he has lost, despite the
fact that one of the city's wealthiest colored
men is a caterer. But if he has lost here,
he has gained along other lines. Among a
number of photographers he has one who is
well-known for his excellent architectural
work. Two manufacturers have brought
out popular goods, the Haynes's razor strop,
and the Howard shoe polish. These men,
one a barber and one a Pullman car porter,
improved upon implements used in their
daily work and then turned to manufac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>ture.
The headquarters of the Howard
shoe polish is in Chicago, where the firm
employs thirty people, the New York branch
giving employment to twelve.</p>

<p>A wise utilization of labor already trained
and at hand is seen in the Manhattan House
Cleaning and Renovating Bureau. This
firm contracts for the cleaning of houses
and places of business and has also been
successful in securing work on new buildings,
entering as the builders leave and arranging
everything for occupancy. In one week the
Bureau has given employment to sixty men.</p>

<p>In those businesses in which he comes in
contact with the white, the most pronounced
success of the colored man has been real estate
brokerage. The New York Negro business
directory names twenty-two real estate
brokers, and though a dozen of them probably
handle altogether no more business
than one white firm, a few put through important
operations. The ablest of these
brokers, recently clearing twenty thousand
dollars at a single transaction, turned his
operations to Liberia, where he went for
a few months to look into land concessions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
This broker has aided the Negroes materially
in their efforts to rent apartments on
better streets. His energy, and that of many
more like him, is also needed to open up
places for colored businesses, better office
and workroom facilities for the able professional
and business men and women. In
New York as in the South the Negro needs
to obtain a hold upon the land. In this he
is aided not only by his brokers, but by
realty companies. The largest of these, the
Metropolitan Realty Company, in operation
since 1900, is capitalized at a million
dollars, and had in 1910 $400,000 paid in
stock, and $400,000 subscribed and being
paid for on instalment. This company operates
in the suburban towns, and has quite
a colony in Plainfield, New Jersey, where it
owns 150 lots. It has built eighty cottages
for its members, and has bought eighteen.</p>

<p>Among the businesses that cater directly
to the colored, probably none is more successful
than undertaking. The Negroes of
the city die in great numbers, and the funeral
is all too common a function. Formerly
this business went to white men, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>creasingly
it is coming into the hands of the
colored. The Negro business directory gives
twenty-two undertakers, one of them, by
common report, the richest colored man in
New York. Profitable real estate investment,
combined with one of the largest
undertaking establishments in the city, has
given him a comfortable fortune. Another
large and increasingly important Negro business
is the hotel and boarding-house. As
the colored men of the South and West accumulate
wealth, they will come in increasing
numbers to visit in New York, and the
colored hotel, now little more than a boarding-house,
may become a spacious building,
with private baths, elevator service, and a
well-equipped restaurant. In today's modestly
equipped buildings the catering is often
excellent, and good, well-cooked food is sold
at reasonable prices. Occasionally the Hotel
Maceo advertises a southern dinner, and its
guests sit down to Virginia sugar-cured ham,
sweet potato pie, and perhaps even opossum.</p>

<p>Printing establishments, tailors' shops,<a name="FNanchor_44_1" id="FNanchor_44_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
express and van companies, and many other
small enterprises help to make up the Negro
business world. One colored printer brings
out an important white magazine. There
are seven weekly colored newspapers, of
which the New York <i>Age</i> is the most important,
and two musical publishing companies.
All these enterprises are useful, not only to
the proprietor and his patrons, but especially
to the clerks and assistants who thus are
able to secure some training in mercantile
work. In the white man's office, white and
colored boys start out together, but as their
trousers lengthen and their ambitions quicken,
the former secures promotion while the latter
is still given the letters to put into the
mail box. If the Negro lad, discouraged at
lack of advancement, leaves the white man
and ventures with a tiny capital into some
business of his own, his ignorance is almost
certain to lead to his disaster. He is indeed
fortunate if he can first work in the office
of a successful colored man.<a name="FNanchor_45_2" id="FNanchor_45_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Examining these figures we find few colored
architects<a name="FNanchor_46_3" id="FNanchor_46_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or engineers, and a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
small proportion of electricians, though
among the latter there is a highly skilled
workman. The New York Negro has no
position in the mechanical arts. It may be
that, as we so often hear, the African does
not possess mechanical ability.<a name="FNanchor_47_4" id="FNanchor_47_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> You do
not see Negro boys pottering over machinery
or making toy inventions of their own.
But another and powerful reason for the
colored youth's failing to take up engineering
or kindred studies is the slight
chance he would later have in securing
work. No group of men in America have
opposed his progress more persistently than
skilled mechanics, and, should he graduate
from some school of technology, he would
be refused in office or workshop. So he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
turns to those professions in which he sees
a likelihood of advancement.</p>

<p>Colored physicians and dentists are increasing
in number in New York and throughout
the country. The Negro is sympathetic, quick
to understand another's feelings, and when
added to this he has received a thorough
medical training he makes an excellent
physician. New York State examinations
prevent the practice of ignorant doctors from
other states, and the city can count many
able colored practitioners. These doctors
practise among white people as well as among
colored. As surgeons they are handicapped
in New York by lack of hospital facilities,
having no suitable place in which they may
perform an operation. The colored student
who graduates from a New York medical
college must go for hospital training to Philadelphia
or Chicago or Washington.<a name="FNanchor_48_5" id="FNanchor_48_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>Colored lawyers are obtaining a firm foothold
in New York. From twenty-six in
the 1900 census they now, in 1911, number
over fifty, though not all of these by any
means rely entirely upon their profession
for support. Some of our lawyers are
descendants of old New York families,
others have come here recently from the
South.</p>

<p>Turning to our census figures again we
see that the three professions in which the
colored man is conspicuous are those of
actor, musician, and minister. Instead of
the average eighteen, he here shows fifty-four
in every thousand actors, thirty in
every thousand musicians, and thirty-two
in every thousand clergymen. And since
the pulpit and the stage are two places in
which the black man has found conspicuous
success it may be well in this connection
to consider, not only the economic
significance of these institutions, but their
place in the life of the colored world.</p>

<p>The Negro minister was born with the
Negro Christian, and the colored church,
in which he might tell of salvation, is over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
a century old in New York. Today the
Boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn have
twenty-eight colored churches besides a
number of missions. Some of the societies
own valuable property, usually, however,
encumbered with heavy mortgages, and
yearly budgets mount up to ten, twelve,
and sixteen thousand dollars. The Methodist
churches lead in number, next come
the Baptist, and next the Episcopalian.
There are Methodist Episcopal, African
Methodist Episcopal, and African Methodist
Episcopal Zion. Bethel African Methodist
Episcopal Church, as we have seen, is
one of the oldest and is still one of the
largest and most useful Negro churches in
New York. Mount Olivet, a Baptist church
on West Fifty-third Street, has a seating
capacity of 1600, taxed to its full on Sunday
evenings. St. Philip's gives the Episcopal
service with dignity and devoutness,
and its choir has many sweet colored boy
singers. At St. Benedict, the Moor, the
black faces of the boy acolytes contrast
with the benignant white-haired Irish priest,
and without need of words preach good-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>will
to men. Only in this Catholic church
does one find white and black in almost
equal numbers worshipping side by side.</p>

<p>The great majority of the colored churches
are supported by their congregations, and
the minister or elder, or both, twice a Sunday,
must call for the pennies and nickels,
dimes and quarters, that are dropped into
the plate at the pulpit's base. Contributors
file past the table on which they place
their offering, emulation becoming a spur
to generosity. These collections are supplemented
by sums raised at entertainments
and fairs, and it is in this way, by the
constant securing of small gifts, that the
thousands are raised.</p>

<p>The church is a busy place and retains
its members, not only by its preaching, but
by midweek meetings. There are the class
meetings of the Methodists, the young people's
societies, the prayer meetings, and
the sermons preached to the secret benefit
organizations. Visiting sisters and brothers
attend to relief work, and standing at a
side table, sometimes picturesque with lighted
lantern, ask for dole for the poor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p>The Sunday-schools, while not so large
as the church attendance would lead one
to expect, involve much time and labor in
their conduct. A colored church member
finds all his or her leisure occupied in church
work. I know a young woman engaged in
an exacting, skilled profession who spends
her day of rest attending morning service,
teaching in Sunday-school, taking part in
the young people's lyceum in the late afternoon,
and listening to a second sermon in
the evening. Occasionally she omits her
dinner to hear an address at the colored
Young Men's Christian Association. On
hot summer afternoons you may see colored
boys and girls and men and women crowded
in an ill-ventilated hall, giving ear to a fervid
exhortation that leads the speaker, at
the sentence's end, to mop his swarthy face.
The woods, the salt-smelling sea, the tamer
prettiness of the lawns of the city's park,
have not the impelling call of sermon or
hymn. If the whole of the Negro's summer
Sunday is to be given to direct religious
teaching, one wishes that it might take
place at the old time camp meeting, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
there is fresh air and space in which to
breathe it. The first of Edward Everett
Hale's three rules of life as he gave them
to the Hampton students was, "Live all
you can out in the open air." The religious-minded
New York Negro succumbs
easily to disease, and yet elects to spend
his day of leisure within doors.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Episcopalians,
the churches undertake little institutional
work. Money is lacking, and there is only
a feeble conviction of the value of the gymnasium,
pool table, and girls' and boys' clubs.
The colored branches of the Young Men's
Christian Association, however, are places
for recreation and instruction. The lines
that Evangelical Americans draw regarding
amusements, prohibiting cards and welcoming
dominos, allowing bagatelle and
frowning upon billiards, must be interpreted
by some folk-lore historian to show their
reasonableness. Doubtless the extent to
which a game is used for gambling purposes
has much to do with its good or bad savor,
and pool and cards for this reason are
tabooed. Dancing is also frowned upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
by many of the churches, while temperance
societies make active campaign for prohibition.
To New York's black folk, the
church-goers and they who stand without
are the sheep and the goats, and the gulf
between them is digged deep.</p>

<p>Of the five colored Episcopal churches, St.
Philip's and St. Cyprian's have parish houses.
St. Philip's has moved into a new parish
house on West One Hundred and Thirty-Fourth
Street, where with its large, well-arranged
rooms, its gymnasium, and its corps
of enthusiastic workers it will soon become
a powerful force in the Harlem Negro's life.
St. Cyprian's is under the City Episcopal
Mission, and has unusual opportunity for
helpfulness since it is separated only by
Amsterdam Avenue from the San Juan Hill
district and yet stands amid the whites.
Its clubs and classes, its employment agency,
its gymnasium, its luncheons for school
children, its beautiful church, are all primarily
for the Negroes; but the colored rector
has a friendly word for his white neighbors,
tow-headed Irish and German boys and girls
sit upon his steps, and his ministry has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
lessened the belligerent feeling between the
east and the west sides of Amsterdam
Avenue. St. David's Episcopal Church in
the Bronx has a fresh air home at White
Plains, cared for personally by the rector
and his wife, who spend their vacation with
tenement mothers and their children, the
tired but grateful recipients of their good-will.</p>

<p>If there were ninety colored clergymen
in New York in 1900, as the census says, a
number must have been without churches,
itinerant preachers or directors of small
missions, supporting themselves by other
labor during the day. Those men who now
fill the pulpits of well-established churches
have been trained in theological schools of
good standing, for the ignorant "darky" of
the story who leaves the hot work of the
cotton field because he feels a "call" to
preach does not receive another from New
York. The colored minister in this city
works hard and long, and finds a wearying
number of demands upon his time. The
wedding and the funeral, the word of counsel
to the young, and of comfort to the aged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
a multiplicity of meetings, two sermons
every Sunday, the continual strain of raising
money, these are some of his duties.
With a day from fourteen to seventeen hours
long he earns as few men earn the meagre
salary put into his hand. But his position
among his people is a commanding one, and
carries with it respect and responsibility.</p>

<p>Strangers who visit colored churches to
be amused by the vociferations of the
preacher and the responses of the congregation
will be disappointed in New York.
Others, however, who attend, desiring to
understand the religious teaching of the
thoughtful Negro, find much of interest.
They hear sermons marked by great eloquence.
In the Evangelical church the
preacher is not afraid to give his imagination
play, and in finely chosen, vivid language,
pictures his thought to his people.
Especially does he love to tell the story of
a future life, of Paradise with its rapturous
beauty of color and sound, its golden streets,
its gates of precious stones, effulgent, radiant.
He dwells not upon the harshness,
but rather upon the mercy of God.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>A theological library connected with a
Calvinistic church, when recently catalogued,
disclosed two long shelves of books
upon Hell and two slim volumes upon
Heaven. No such unloving Puritanism dominates
the Negro's thought. Hell's horrors
may be portrayed at a revival to bring the
sinner to repentance, but only as an aid to
a clearer vision of the glories of Heaven.</p>

<p>The Negro churches lay greater stress
than formerly upon practical religion; they
try to turn a fine frenzy into a determination
for righteousness. This was strikingly exemplified
lately in one of New York's colored
Baptist churches. During the solemn
rite of immersion the congregation began to
grow hysterical, or "happy," as they would
have phrased it; there were cries of "Yes,
Jesus," "We're comin', Lord," and swayings
of the body backward and forward. The
minister with loud and stirring appeal for
a time encouraged these emotions. Then
in a moment he brought quiet to his congregation
and called them to the consecration
of labor. Faith without works was vain.
Baptism was not the end, but only the begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>ning
of their salvation. "You-all bleege
ter work," he said, "if yer gwine foller der
Lord. Ain't Jesus work in der carpenter
shop till he nigh on thirty year old? Den
one day he stood up (he ain't none er yer
two-by-fo' men) an' he tak off his blue apun
(I reckon he wore er apun like we-alls) an'
he goes on down ter der wilderness, an'
John der Baptist baptize him."</p>

<p>From oratory one turns naturally to
music. The feeling for rhythm, for melodious
sound, that leads the Negro to use
majestic words of which he has not always
mastered the meaning, leads him also to
musical expression. He has an instinct
for harmony, and, when within hearing distance
of any instrument, will whistle, not
the melody, however assertive, but will
add a part.<a name="FNanchor_49_6" id="FNanchor_49_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Those who have visited colored
schools, and especially the colored
schools of the far South where the pupils
are unfamiliar with other music than their
own, can never forget the exquisite, haunting
singing. When a foreman wants to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
energetic work from his black laborers he
sets them to singing stirring tunes. The
Negro has his labor songs as the sailor has
his chanties, and it would be impossible to
measure the joy coming to both through
musical expression.</p>

<p>In New York, despite their poverty, few
Negroes fail to possess some musical instrument&mdash;a
banjo perhaps, or a guitar, a
mandolin or zither, or it may be the highly
prized piano. Visiting of an evening in
the Phipps model tenement, one hears a
variety of gay tinkling sounds. And besides
the mechanical instruments there is always
the great natural instrument, the human
voice. Singing, though not as common in
the city as in the country, is still often heard,
especially in the summer, and remains musical,
though New York's noise and cheap
and vulgar entertainments have an unhappy
fashion of roughening her children's voices.</p>

<p>Music furnishes a means of livelihood to
many Negroes and supplements the income
of many others. Boys contribute to the
family support by singing cheap songs in
saloons or even in houses of prostitution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
A boy "nightingale" will earn the needed
money for rent while learning, all too quickly,
the ways of viciousness. Others, more carefully
reared, sing at church or secret society
concert, perhaps receiving a little pay.
Men form male quartettes that for five or
ten dollars furnish a part of an evening's
entertainment. There are many Negro
musicians and elocutionists who largely
support themselves by their share in the
receipts from concerts and social gatherings.</p>

<p>We speak of men crossing the line when
they intermarry with the whites, but there
is another crossing of the line when some
Negro by his genius makes the world forget
his race. Such a man is the artist,
Henry Tanner; and New York has such
Negro musicians. Mr. Harry Burleigh, the
baritone at St. George's, has won high recognition,
not only as an interpreter, but as
a composer of music; and one of the richest
synagogues of the city has a Negro for its
assistant organist. There are five colored
orchestras in New York, the one conducted
by Mr. Walter A. Craig having toured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
successfully in New England and many other
northern states.</p>

<p>But the colored musician has usually
found his opportunity for expression and
for a living wage upon the stage. Probably
many of the actors noted on the census list
are musicians, and many of the musicians,
actors; the writer of the topical song having
himself sung it in vaudeville or musical
comedy. Few New Yorkers appreciate how
many of the tunes hummed in the street
or ground out on the hand-organ, have originated
in Negro brains. "The Right Church
but the Wrong Pew," "Teasing," "Nobody,"
"Under the Bamboo Tree," which Cole and
Johnson, the composers, heard the last
thing as they left the dock in New York, and
the first thing when they arrived in Paris,
these are a few of the popular favorites.
Handsome incomes have been netted by the
shrewder among these composers, and the
demand for their songs is continuous.</p>

<p>With a bright song and a jolly dance
comes success. Picking up the copy of the
New York <i>Age</i>, that lies on my desk, I find
jottings of twenty-four colored troupes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
vaudeville in the larger cities of the North
and West. Three are at Proctor's and three
at Keith's. Their economic outlook is not
so hilarious as their songs, for transportation
is expensive and bookings are uncertain;
yet pecuniarily these actors are far
better off than their more sober brothers
who stick to their elevators or their porters'
jobs.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago the Negro performer
probably had little anticipation of advancing
beyond minstrel work, in which he sang
loud, danced hard, and told a funny story.
S. H. Dudley, the leading comedian in the
"Smart Set" colored company, said in
1909: "When I started in business I had
no idea of getting as high as I am now. A
minstrel company came to the little town in
Texas where I was raised, and at once my
ambition fired me to become a musician.
So I bought a battered horn and began to
toot, to the great annoyance of my neighbors.
Then I secured an engagement with a minstrel
company whose cornet player had
fallen into the hands of the law; and now
here I am with one of the best colored shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
ever gotten together and a starring tour
arranged for next season." The movement
from the minstrel show to the musical comedy,
from the cheapest form of buffoonery to
attractive farce, and even to good comedy,
has been accomplished by a number of
colored comedians. Williams and Walker
may be considered the pioneers in this
movement, and the story of their success,
as Walker has told it, is a fine example of
what the Negro can do along the line of
decided natural aptitude. And it is important
to notice this, for today, in the education
of the race, sthetic instincts are often
suppressed with Puritan vigor, and labor is
made ugly and unwelcome.</p>

<p>Bert Williams and George Walker, one a
British West Indian, the other a Westerner,
met in California where each was hanging
around a box manager's office, looking for a
job. Hardly more than boys, they secured
employment at seven dollars a week. That
was in 1889. In 1908 they made each
$250 a week, and in later times they have
doubled and quadrupled this. Their first
stage manager expected them to perform as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the blacked-up white minstrels were performing,
but the two boys soon saw that the
Negro himself was far more entertaining than
the buffoon portrayed by the white man.
They wanted to show the true Negro, and
billing themselves as the "real coons" (their
white rivals called themselves "coons") they
played in San Francisco with some success.
Later they came to New York, and at Koster
and Bial's made their first hit.</p>

<p>"Long before our run terminated," Walker
said in telling of those early days, "we discovered
an important fact: that the hope of
the colored performer must be in making a
radical departure from the old time 'darky'
style of singing and dancing. So we set
ourselves the task of thinking along new
lines.</p>

<p>"The first move was to hire a flat in
Fifty-third Street, furnish it, and throw our
doors open to all colored men who possessed
theatrical and musical ability and ambition.
The Williams and Walker flat soon
became the headquarters of all the artistic
young men of our race who were stage-struck.
We entertained the late Paul Law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>rence
Dunbar, who wrote lyrics for us.
By having these men about us we had the
opportunity to study the musical and theatrical
ability of the most talented members
of our race."</p>

<p>In 1893 the World's Fair was held at
Chicago, and on the "Midway" the visitor
saw races from all over the world. Here
was a Dahomey village, with strange little
huts, representative of the African home
life. The Dahomeyans themselves were late
in arriving, and American Negroes, sometimes
with an added coat of black, were
employed to represent them. Among them
were Williams and Walker, who played
their parts until the real Dahomeyans arriving,
they became in turn spectators and
studied the true African. This contact
with the dancing and singing of the primitive
people of their own race had an important
effect upon their art. Their lyrics
recalled African songs, their dancing took
on African movements, especially Walker's.
Any one who saw Walker in "Abyssinia,"
the most African and the most artistic of
their plays, must have recognized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
savage beauty of his dancing when he was
masquerading as an African king.</p>

<p>After the Dahomey episode the success
of the two men was continuous. "In 1902
and 1903," Walker said, "we had all New
York and London doing the cake walk." In
February, 1908, they appeared in "Bandanna
Land," at the Majestic Theatre, and
remained there for six months. Only those
colored men who have made a steady, uphill
struggle for the chance to play good comedy,
know how important such recognition was
for the Negro. "Bandanna Land" was
probably the most popular light opera in
New York that winter next to "The Merry
Widow." The singing, especially that of
the male chorus, was often beautiful. Mrs.
Walker's dancing and charming acting were
delightful, the chorus girls were above the
average in beauty and musical expression,
and the two men who made the piece were
spontaneously, irresistibly funny; added
to this, unlike its successful rival, "Bandanna
Land" was without a vulgar scene
or word.</p>

<p>This was the last time the two men played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
together. Walker became seriously ill, and
died in January, 1911. After their company
disbanded, Williams went back to the one-piece
act of vaudeville, but as a star in a
white troupe. His position as a permanent
actor in the "Follies of 1910" marks a new
departure for the colored comedian, a departure
won by great talent combined with
character and tact.</p>

<p>Since 1908 the Majestic has seen another
colored company, Cole and Johnson's, presenting
a half-Negro, half-Indian, musical
comedy, the "Red Moon." These two men,
for years in vaudeville, have written songs
for Lillian Russell, Marie Cahill, Anna Held,
and other popular musical comedy and
vaudeville singers. They have played for six
months continuously at the Palace Theatre,
London. Accustomed to writing for white
actors, their own plays are not so distinctively
African as Williams and Walker's.
Both Johnson and Cole are of the mulatto
type, and neither blackens his face. Cole
is one of the most amusing men in comedy
in New York. He is tall and very thin,
with a genius for finding lank and gro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>tesque
costumes that are delightfully incongruous
with his grave face. The words of
the musical comedies are his, the music,
Johnson's. He, too, has become seriously
ill, and his company has disbanded. In
three years the colored stage has suffered
serious loss, but we see forming new and
successful companies whose reputation will
soon be assured.</p>

<p>Comedy has always furnished a medium
for criticism of the foibles of the times, and
there are many sly digs at the white man
in the colored play. Ernest Hogan, now
deceased, better than any one else played
the rural southern darky. In the "Oysterman"
we saw him in contact with a white
scamp who was intent upon getting his recently
acquired money. He was urged to
take stock in a land company, to buy where
watermelons grew as thick as potatoes,
and chickens were as common as sparrows.
The audience hated the white man heartily
and sided with the simple, kindly, black
youth, sitting with his dog at his side, on
his cabin steps. Behind boisterous laughter
and raillery the writers of these comedies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
often gain the sympathy of their hearers
for the black race.</p>

<p>In this attempt to show the occupational
life of the Negro, we have found that race
prejudice often proves a bar to complete
success, to full manhood. Something of this
is true with the actor as well as with the
laborer and the business man. In securing
entrance in vaudeville, color is at first an
advantage. The "darky" to the white man
is grotesquely amusing, and by rolling his
eyes, showing a glistening smile, and wearing
shoes that make a monstrosity of his
feet, the Negro may create a laugh where
the man with a white skin would be hooted
off the stage. And since the laugh is so
easily won, many colored actors become
indolent and content themselves, year after
year, with playing the part of buffoon.
But with the ambition to rise in his profession
comes the difficult struggle to induce
the audience to see a new Negro in the black
man of today. The public gives the colored
man no opportunity as a tragedian,
demanding that his comedy shall border
always on the farcical. And what is de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>manded
of the actor is also demanded of the
musician. Writers of the scores of some
of our musical comedies are musicians of
superior training and ability, but rarely
are they permitted full expression. Mr.
Will Marion Cook, the composer of much of
the music of "Bandanna Land," for a few
moments gives a piece of exquisite orchestration.
When the colored minister rises
and exhorts his quarrelling friends to be at
peace with one another, one hears a beautiful
harmony. I am told that Mr. Cook
declares that the next score he writes shall
begin with ten minutes of serious music.
If the audience doesn't like it, they can come
in late, but for ten minutes he will do something
worthy of his genius.</p>

<p>However light-hearted a people, and however
worthy of praise the entertainment
that brings a jolly, wholesome laugh, let
us hope that in the near future the Negro
will find a more complete expression for
his musical and histrionic gifts. Some actor
of commanding talent, whose claims cannot
be ignored, may reveal the larger life of
the race. The nineteenth century knew a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
great Negro actor, Ira Aldridge, a <i>protg</i>
and disciple of Edmund Kean. He played
Othello to Kean's Iago, and in the forties
toured Europe with his own company,
receiving high honors in Berlin and St.
Petersburg.<a name="FNanchor_50_7" id="FNanchor_50_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> A dark-skinned African, of
immense power, physically and emotionally,
he made Desdemona cry out in real fear,
and caused Bassanio instinctively to shrink
as he demanded his pound of flesh. Today's
actor must be more subtle in his attack,
but it may be given to him to reveal the
thoughts at the back of the black man's
mind. The genius of Zangwill gave us the
picture of the children of the Ghetto; perhaps
from the theatre's seat the American
will first understand the despised black race.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Colored Woman as a Bread Winner</span></h2>


<p>The life of the Negro woman of New York,
if she belong to the laboring class, differs in
some important respects from the life of the
white laboring woman. Generalizations on
so comprehensive a subject must, of course,
meet with many exceptions, but the observing
visitor, familiar with white and colored
neighborhoods, quickly notes marked contrasts
between the two, contrasts largely the
result of different occupational opportunities.
These pertain both to the married woman
and the unmarried working girl.</p>

<p>The generality of white women in New
York, wives of laboring men, infrequently
engage in gainful occupations. In the early
years of married life the wife relies on her
husband's wage for support, and within her
tiny tenement-flat bears and rears her chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>dren
and performs her household duties&mdash;the
sewing, cooking, washing, and ironing,
and the daily righting of the contracted
rooms. She is a conscientious wife and
mother, and rarely, either by night or by day,
journeys far from her own home. When unemployment
visits the family wage earner,
she turns to laundry work and day's cleaning
for money to meet the rent and to supply the
household with scanty meals; but as soon as
her husband resumes work she returns to
her narrow round of domestic duties.</p>

<p>After a score of these monotonous years
more prosperous times come to the housewife.
Every morning two or three children
go out to work, and their wages make heavier
the family purse. Son and daughter, having
entered factory or store, bring home their
pay envelopes unbroken on Saturday nights,
and the augmentation of the father's wage
gives the mother an income to administer.
After the young people's wants in clothing
and entertainment have been in part supplied,
it becomes possible to buy new furniture
on the instalment plan, to hire a piano,
even to move into a better neighborhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
The earnings of a number of children, supplementing
the wage of the head of the
family, make life more tolerable for all.</p>

<p>These days, however, do not last long.
Sons and daughters marry and assume new
responsibilities; the husband, his best strength
gone, finds unemployment increasing; and
since saving, except for wasteful industrial
insurance, has seemed impossible without
sacrificing the decencies and pleasures of
the children, the end of the woman's married
life is likely to be hard and comfortless.</p>

<p>This rough description may fairly be taken
to represent the life of the average New
York white woman of the laboring class. It
is not, however, the life of the average colored
woman. With her, self-sustaining work
usually begins at fifteen, and by no means
ceases with her entrance upon marriage,
which only entails new financial burdens.
The wage of the husband, as we have seen,
is usually insufficient to support a family,
save in extreme penury, and the wife accepts
the necessity of supplementing the husband's
income. This she accomplishes by taking
in washing or by entering a private family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to do housework. Sometimes she is away
from her tenement nearly every day in the
week; again the bulk of her earnings comes
from home industry. Her day holds more
diversity than that of her white neighbor;
she meets more people, becomes familiar
with the ways of the well-to-do,&mdash;their
household decorations, their dress, their refinements
of manner; but she has but few
hours to give to her children. With her
husband she is ready to be friend and helpmate;
but should he turn out a bad bargain,
she has no fear of leaving him, since
her marital relations are not welded by
economic dependence. An industrious, competent
woman, she works and spends, and in
her scant hours of leisure takes pride in keeping
her children well-dressed and clean.</p>

<p>At the second period of her married life,
when her boys and girls, few in number if
she be a New Yorker, begin to engage in
self-supporting work, her condition shows
less improvement than that of the white
woman of her class. Sometimes her children
hand her their whole wage, far oftener
they bring her only such part as they choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
to spare. The strict accounting of the minor
to the parent, usual among Northerners in
the past, and today common among the
immigrant class, is not a part of the Negro's
training. Rather, as the race has attained
freedom it has copied the indulgent attitude
of the once familiar "master," and regrets
that its offspring must enter upon any work.
Children with this tradition about them use
the money they earn largely for the gratification
of their vanity, not for the lessening of
their mother's tasks. But a more potent
factor than lack of discipline keeps the
mother from being the administrator of the
family's joint earnings. White boys and
girls in New York enter work that makes it
possible and advantageous for them to dwell
at home; Negroes must go out to service,
accept long and irregular hours in hotel or
apartment, travel for days on boat or train.
The family home is infrequently available
to them, and money given in to it brings
small return. Under these circumstances it
is not strange if the mother must continue
her round of washing and scrubbing.</p>

<p>The last years of life of the Negro woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
probably a little more than the last years of
the white, are likely to bring happiness.
With a mother at work a grandmother
becomes an important factor, and elderly
colored women are often seen bringing up
little children or helping in the laundry&mdash;that
great colored home industry. Accustomed
all their lives to hard labor, it is easy
for them to find work that shall repay their
support, and in their children's households
they are treated with respect and consideration.</p>

<p>The contrast in the lives of the colored and
white married women is not more strongly
marked than the contrast in the lives of their
unmarried daughters and sisters. Unable to
enter any pursuit except housework, the
unskilled colored girl goes out to service or
helps at home with the laundry or sewing.
Factory and store are closed to her, and
rarely can she take a place among other
working girls. Her hours are the long, irregular
hours of domestic service. She brings
no pay envelope home to her mother, the
two then carefully discussing how much
belongs rightfully for board, and how much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
may go for the new coat or dress, but takes
the eighteen or twenty dollars given her at
the end of the month, and quite by herself
determines all her expenditures. Far oftener
than any class of white girls in the city she
lives away from the parental home.</p>

<p>These are some of the differences found by
the observer who looks into the Negro and
the white tenement. They need not, however,
rest alone upon any observer's testimony.
We have in the census abundant
statistics for their verification. Scattered
among the volumes on Population, Occupations,
and Women at Work are many facts
concerning Negro women workers of New
York, all of them confirmatory of the description
just given. We may note the most
important.</p>

<p>In 1900, whereas 4.2 per cent of the white
married women in New York were engaged
in gainful occupations, 31.4 per cent of the
Negro married women were earning their
living, over seven times as many in proportion
as the whites.<a name="FNanchor_51_1" id="FNanchor_51_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
<p>Again, in the total population of New
York's women workers, 80 per cent were
single, 10 per cent married, and 10 per cent
widowed and divorced; while among the
Negroes, the single women were only 53
per cent, the married 25 per cent, and the
widowed 22.<a name="FNanchor_52_2" id="FNanchor_52_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Statistics of the age period at which women
are at work, show the Negro's long continuing
wage-earning activity. Between sixteen and
twenty is a busy time for the women of both
races. Among the whites 59 per cent are
in gainful occupations, among the Negroes
66 per cent. But as the girl arrives at the
period when she is likely to marry, the
per cent of workers among the whites
drops rapidly, until for white women,
forty-five and over, it is 13.5, about one
in seven. With the colored, among the
women forty-five years of age and over, 53<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
per cent, more than half, still engage in
gainful toil.<a name="FNanchor_53_3" id="FNanchor_53_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Family life can be studied in the census
table. While 59 per cent of the unmarried
white girls at work live at home, this is
found to be true of but 25 per cent of the
colored girls; that is, 75 per cent, three-quarters
of all the colored unmarried working
women, live with their employers or board.<a name="FNanchor_54_4" id="FNanchor_54_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The census volume on occupations reveals
at once the narrow range of the New York
colored woman's working life. Personal and
domestic service absorbs 90 per cent of her
numbers against 40 per cent among the
white. But before considering more fully
the colored girl at work, we need to notice
another statistical fact, the preponderance
in the city of Negro women over Negro
men.</p>

<p>Like the foreigner, the youth of the Negro
race comes first to the city to seek a livelihood.
The colored population shows 41 per
cent of its number between the ages of 20<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and 35. But unlike the foreigner, the Negro
women find larger opportunity and come in
greater numbers than the men. Their range
of work is narrow, but within it they can
command double the wages they receive at
home, and if they are possessed of average
ability, they are seldom long out of work.
With the immense growth of wealth in New
York the demand for servants continually
increases, and finding little response from the
white native born population, many mistresses
receive readily the services of the
English-speaking southern and West Indian
blacks. So the boats from Charleston and
Norfolk and the British West Indies bring
scores and hundreds of Negro women from
country districts, from cities where they have
spent a short time at service, girls with and
girls without experience, all seeking better
wages in a new land.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly Miller was the first to call
attention to the presence in American cities
of surplus Negro women.<a name="FNanchor_55_5" id="FNanchor_55_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The phenomenon
is not peculiar to New York. Baltimore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Washington, New Orleans, all show the same
condition. In Atlanta the women number
143 to every hundred colored men. New
York shows 123 to every masculine one hundred.
These surplus women account in part
for the number of Negro women workers in
New York not living at home. Some are
with their employers, but others lodge in the
already crowded tenements, for the southern
servant, unaccustomed to spending the night
at her employer's, in New York also, frequently
arranges to leave her mistress when
her work is done. In their hours of leisure
the surplus women are known to play havoc
with their neighbors' sons, even with their
neighbors' husbands, for since lack of men
makes marriage impossible for about a fifth
of New York's colored girls, social disorder
results. Surplus Negro women, able to secure
work, support idle, able-bodied Negro
men. The lounger at the street corner, the
dandy in the parlor thrumming on his banjo,
means a Malindy of the hour at the kitchen
washboard. In a town in Germany, where
men were sadly scarce, I was told that a
servant girl paid as high as a mark to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
soldier to walk with her in the Hofgarten
on a Sunday afternoon. Colored men in
New York command their "mark," and girls
are found who keep them in polished boots,
fashionable coats, and well-creased trousers.
Could the Negro country boy be as certain
as his sister of lucrative employment in New
York, or could he oftener persuade her to
remain with him on the farm, he would
better city civilization. But the demand for
servants increases, and the colored girl continues
to be attracted to the city where she
can earn and spend.</p>

<p>The table on the following page shows in
condensed form the occupations of the Negro
women in New York. As we see, the Negro
women number forty-four in every thousand
women workers.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>Ninety per cent of all the Negro women
workers of New York are in domestic and
personal service. This includes a variety of
positions. Some Negro girls work in stores,
dusting stock, taking charge of cloak or
toilet rooms, scrubbing floors. Their hours
are regular, but the pay, five or six, or very
occasionally eight dollars a week, means a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
scanty livelihood without hope of advancement.
The position of maid in a theatre
where perquisites are larger is prized, and a
new and pleasant place is that of a maid on
a limited train. But the bulk of the girls
are servants in boarding-houses, or are with
private families as nurses, waitresses, cooks,
laundresses, maids-of-all-work, earning from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
sixteen and eighteen to twenty-five and even
thirty dollars a month. Occasionally a very
skilful cook can command as high a monthly
wage as fifty dollars.</p>

<p>The colored girl is frequently found engaged
at general housework in a small apartment.
Her desire to return to her lodging
at night makes her popular with families
living in contracted space. With the conveniences
of a New York flat, dumb-waiter,
clothes-dryer, gas, and electricity, general
housework is not severe. Work begins early,
seven at the latest, and lasts until the dinner
is cleared away, at half-past eight or nine.
Released then from further tasks, the young
girl goes to her tiny inner tenement room,
dons a fresh dress, and then, as chance or her
training determines, walks the streets, goes
to the theatre, or attends the class meeting
at her church. Entertainments among the
Negroes are rarely under way until ten
o'clock, and short hours of sleep in ill-ventilated
rooms soon weaken the vitality of
the new-comer. Housework under these
conditions does not create much ambition;
the mistress moves, flitting, in New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
fashion, from one flat to another, and the
girl also flits among employers, changing
with the whim of the moment.</p>

<p>Few subjects present so fascinating a field
for discussion as domestic service, and the
housewife of today enters into it with energy,
sometimes decrying the modern working girl,
again planning household economics that
shall lure her from factory or shop. The
only point we need to consider now is the
dissatisfaction that results when 64 per cent
of the women of a race are forced by circumstances
into one occupation. Those with native
ability along this line succeed and make
others and themselves happy. The faithful,
patient, loyal Negro servant is well-known,
the black mammy has passed into American
literature, but not every colored woman can
wisely be given this position. Some of the
Negro girls who take up housework in New
York are capable of more intelligent labor,
and chafe under their limitations; others
have not the ability to do good housework;
for domestic service requires more mental
capacity than is demanded in many factories.
In short, a great many colored girls in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
New York are round pegs in square holes,
and the community is the loser by it.</p>

<p>Among these round pegs are girls who,
determining no longer to drudge in lonely
kitchens, contrive, as we shall see later, to
find positions at other more attractive reputable
work. Others, deciding in favor of
material betterment at whatever cost, lower
their moral standard and secure easier and
more remunerative jobs. A well-paying
place, with short hours and high tips, at once
offers itself to the colored girl who is willing
to work for a woman of the demi-monde.
In the sporting house also she is preferred
as a servant, her dark complexion separating
her from other inmates. In 1858, Sanger
wrote in his "History of Prostitution," "The
servants (in these houses) are almost always
colored women. Their wages are liberal,
their perquisites considerable, and their
work light." Untrained herself, bereft of
home influence, with an ancestry that sometimes
cries out her parent's weakness in the
contour and color of her face, the Negro girl
in New York, more even than the foreign
immigrant, is subject to degrading tempta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>tion.
The good people, who are often so
exacting, want her for her willingness to
work long hours at a lower wage than the
white; and the bad people, who are often so
carelessly kind, offer her light labor and
generous pay. It is small wonder that she
sometimes chooses the latter.</p>

<p>Not all the colored girls who work in
questionable places and with questionable
people take the jobs from choice; some are
sent without knowing the character of the
house they enter. A few years ago an agitation
was started for the protection of helpless
Negro immigrants who had fallen into the
hands of unscrupulous employment agencies.
A system existed, and still exists, by which
employment agencies were able to advance
the travelling expenses of southern girls, who
on their arrival in New York were held in
debt until the cost of the journey had been
many times repaid. Helpless in the power
of the agent, the new-comer was forced to
work where he wished. Under the city's
department of licenses some of the more
unscrupulous of these agencies have been
closed, and philanthropy has placed a visitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
at the docks to give aid and advice to unprotected
girls. But the danger is by no
means over. Those familiar with the subject
assert that there is a proportionately
larger black slave than white slave traffic.</p>

<p>There is a gainful occupation for women,
black and white, too important to be left
unnoticed. The census does not tabulate it.
The best people strive to ignore it, and carefully
sheltered girls grow up unconscious of
its existence. But the employment agent
understands its commercial value, and little
children in the red light neighborhood are as
familiar with it as with the vending of peanuts
on the street. To the poor it is always
an open door affording at least a temporary
respite from dispossession and starvation.
How many of the colored turn to it, we do
not know&mdash;certainly not a few. Some gain
from it a meagre livelihood, but others, for
a time at least, achieve comfort and even
luxury.</p>

<p>Among the round pegs that the square
holes so uncomfortably chafe are colored girls
of intelligence and charm who deliberately
join the anti-social class. Probably a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
in any case would lead this life, but the history
of many shows an unsuccessful struggle
for congenial work, ending with a choice of
material comfort however high the moral
cost. In One Hundred and Thirty-fourth
and One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Streets
are apartments where such girls live, two or
three together, surrounded by comforts that
their respectable neighbors who go out to
cook, wash, and iron may fruitlessly long
for all their lives. A colored philanthropic
worker, stopping by chance at the door of
one of these places, saw an old college friend.
"How can you do it!" she cried as she recognized
the life the girl was leading, "How can
you do it! I would rather kill myself scrubbing!"
"There is the difference between
us," came the answer, "I am not willing to
die, and I cannot and will not scrub."</p>

<p>It is pleasant and encouraging to turn from
colored women who have given up the
struggle, to ambitious, successful workers.
Some among these are in the domestic service
group and enjoy with heartiness their
tasks as nurse-maid or cook. "This is my
piano day," an expert colored washerwoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
says of a Monday morning. Among the
domestic service workers, as classified by the
census, is the trained nurse, filling an increasingly
important position in New York. In
1909, Lincoln Hospital graduated twenty-one
colored nurses, some of whom remain in
New York to do excellent work.</p>

<p>In the professions, with the women as
with the men, the first place numerically is
occupied by performers upon the stage. So
much has been said of the Negro as an actor
that there is little to add. A rather better
class of colored than of white women join
musical comedy chorus troupes, for fifteen or
eighteen dollars a week that will attract a
Negro to the stage can be made by a white
girl in a dozen other ways. Lightness of
color seems a requisite for a stage position,
unless a dark skin is offset by very great
ability, as in the case of Aida Walker, one of
the most graceful and charming women in
musical comedy.</p>

<p>No record is kept of the number of colored
teachers in the city's public schools, but each
year Negro graduates from the normal college
secure positions. These are found from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the kindergarten through the primary and
up to the highest grammar grade. The
colored girl with intellectual ability, particularly
if she comes of an old New York
family, is apt to turn to teaching. Her
novitiate is long, but a permanent certificate
secured, she is sure of a good salary,
increasing with her years of service, and
ending in a pension. This path of security
has perhaps tended to keep New York colored
girls from going into other lines of
work. I have not yet found one who has
graduated from a university. Pratt Institute
and the Teachers' College have colored
normal students, but they are usually from
the South or West, not New Yorkers born.</p>

<p>Philanthropy is opening up important lines
of opportunity to the Negro woman in New
York. In 1903, a colored graduate nurse
secured an interview with the Secretary of
the New York Charity Organization Society,
and so ably presented to him the need of
Negro visitors among Negroes that she was
appointed visiting nurse for the colored sick
who came under the notice of the Society.
In time the position changed into that of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
colored district visitor, other colored nurses
entering in numbers into district nursing
work. In 1910, three nurses were employed
by the Nurses' Settlement, two by the Association
for Improving the Condition of the
Poor of Manhattan, and two by the District
Nursing Association of Brooklyn. With increased
knowledge of the sickness and suffering
amid the Negro poor, and of their need
of proper care in their homes, the number of
these nurses will doubtless increase. Colored
women rank high among the trained nurses
of New York.</p>

<p>Other philanthropic work lately has been
undertaken by Negro women in New York.
In 1910, besides the nurses of whom we have
spoken, there were at the head of societies in
salaried positions, two settlement workers,
two matrons of day nurseries, two matrons of
homes in which much social work was carried
on, many employees in colored orphan
asylums, a teacher of domestic science in a
home-keeping flat, a traveller's aid visitor, a
playground instructor, besides workers in
various religious organizations. This does
not include the many colored women doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
social and recreation work in the public
schools and on the city's playgrounds. Indeed,
the difficulty in New York is to secure
trained colored women for philanthropic
work, the Negro's attitude still being that
of the great majority of white women a few
years ago, that love for children and a sentimental
kindness constitute the requisites
for work among the poor. But the school
of experience is training workers, and as
the schools of philanthropy of New York,
Boston, and Chicago also graduate colored
students, we shall have in the North the
intelligent, trained workers whom we need.</p>

<p>The little kindergarten girl who, with head
erect, walked past the jeering line of boys
to the green trees and soft grass of the
park has her counterpart in many young
women of New York. In 1909, a colored
girl graduated from one of the city's dental
colleges, the first woman of her race to take
this degree in the state. From the first
her success was remarkable. Colored girls
with ability and steady purpose and dogged
determination have won success in clerical
and business work; but the last large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
efficient group is that classified in the census
under mechanical and manufacturing pursuits:
the dressmakers, seamstresses, milliners.</p>

<p>Colored women have always been known
as good sewers, and recently they have
studied at their trade in some of the best
schools. From 1904 to 1910, the Manhattan
Trade School graduated thirty-four colored
girls in dressmaking, hand sewing, and novelty
making. The public night school on
West Forty-sixth Street, under its able colored
principal, Dr. W. L. Bulkley, since 1907,
has educated hundreds of women in sewing,
dressmaking, millinery, and artificial flower-making.
While the majority of the pupils
have taken the courses for their private use,
a large minority are entering the business
world. They meet with repeated difficulties;
white girls refuse to work in shops with them,
private employers object to their color, but
they have, nevertheless, made creditable progress.
The census reports the number of
Negro dressmakers to have quadrupled in
the United States from 1890 to 1900. Something
comparable to this increase in dressmaking
and allied trades has taken place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
among the Negroes of New York, and it has
come through education and persistence, and
the increase of trade among the colored group
itself. Numbers of these dressmakers and
milliners earn a livelihood, though often a
scanty one, from the patronage of the people
of their own race.</p>

<p>But despite her efforts and occasional successes,
the colored girl in New York meets
with severer race prejudice than the colored
man, and is more persistently kept from
attractive work. <i>She gets the job that the
white girl does not want.</i> It may be that the
white girls want the wrong thing, and that
the jute mill and tobacco shop and flower
factory are more dangerous to health and
right living than the mistress's kitchen, but
she knows her mind, and follows the business
that brings her liberty of action when the
six o'clock whistle blows. What she desires
for herself, however, she refuses to her colored
neighbor. Occasionally an employer objects
to colored girls, but the Manhattan Trade
School repeatedly, in trying to place its
graduates, has found that opposition to the
Negro has come largely from the working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
girls. Race prejudice has even gone so far
as to prevent a colored woman from receiving
home work when it entailed her waiting in
the same sitting-room with white women.
Of course, this is not the universal attitude.
In friendly talks with hundreds of New
York's white women workers, I have found
the majority ready to accept the colored
worker. Jewish girls are especially tolerant.
They believe that good character and decent
manners should count, not color; but an
aggressive, combative minority is quite sure
that no matter how well educated or virtuous
she may be, no black woman is as good
as a white one. So the few but belligerent
aristocrats triumph over the many half-ashamed,
timid democrats.</p>

<p>The shirtwaist makers' strike of 1910 was
so profoundly important in its breaking
down of feeling between nationalities, its
union of all working women in a common
cause, that the colored girl, while very
slightly concerned in the strike itself, may
profit by the more generous feeling it engendered.
Certainly an entrance into store and
workshop would be to her immense advan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>tage.
She needs the discipline of regular
hours, of steady training, of order and system.
She needs also to become part of a
strong labor group, to share its working
class ideal, to feel the weight of its moral
opinion; instead of looking into the mirror
of her wealthy mistress, she needs to reflect
the aspirations of the strong, earnest women
who toil.</p>

<p>Before bringing the story of the life of the
New York colored working woman to a
close, it may not be amiss to look closely at
the discrimination practised against her, not
only in her work, but in her daily life. The
Negro comes North and finds himself half a
man. Does the woman, too, come to be
but half a woman? What is her status in
the city to which she turns for opportunity
and larger freedom?</p>

<p>Four years ago, within a few hours' time,
two stories were told me, illustrative of the
colored woman's status. Neither occurred
in the city of New York, but both are indicative
of its temper. The first I heard from
a woman skilled in a difficult profession, a
Canadian now residing in the United States,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and the descendant of a fugitive slave.
Her youthful companions had all been white,
and while an African in the darkness of her
skin and her musical voice, her rearing had
been that of an Englishwoman. "Shortly
after coming to New York, I went for the
first time," she told me, "to a little resort on
the Jersey coast. A board walk flanked the
ocean, and on the other side were shops
and places of amusement. Going out one
morning with two companions, a colored
man and woman, we turned into an enclosure
to examine a gaily painted merry-go-round.
The place was open to the public, and a few
nursery maids with their charges were seated
about. The man in our party, interested in
the mechanism of the machine, went up to
it and began to explain it to us. Quite suddenly
a rough fellow, in charge of the place,
walked over and called out, 'Get out of here!
We don't allow niggers.' The attack, to me
at least, was so overwhelming that I did not
move at once. Thereupon I was again
called 'nigger,' and ordered out.</p>

<p>"When I reached the beach, I asked my
companions to leave me, and I sat on a bench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
looking upon the waves. After a time an
old woman came to my side, and said a little
timidly, 'What are you thinking about,
dearie?' Looking in her face I saw that she
feared that I would commit suicide. 'I am
thinking,' I said turning to her, 'that I wish
the ocean might rise up and drown every
white person on the face of the earth.' 'Oh,
you mustn't say that,' she cried horrified,
and left me. After I cannot tell how many
minutes or hours, I returned to my boarding-house,
and then to my home in New York.
I had had a great many white friends in my
native home; I had played with them, eaten
with them, slept with them. Now I destroyed
their letters, and resolved never to
know them again. That was my first affront
in the United States, and while I have
learned to feel somewhat differently, a little
to discriminate, I can never forget that the
white people in the North stand for the
insult which was cast upon me."</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day I had
learned of this happening, a man from a
prominent college in New York State told
me of a Negro classmate. "He was a pleas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>ant,
intelligent fellow from the South," he
said, "and while I never knew him well, I
was always glad to see him. One day, at
commencement time, when we were all having
our relatives about, he boarded my car
with a young colored woman, evidently his
sister. Without a thought I rose, lifted my
hat, and gave her my seat. Never again
shall I see such a look of gratitude as that
which lighted up his face when he bowed
in acknowledgment of my courtesy. It revealed
the race question to me, and yet I
had performed only the simplest act of a
gentleman."</p>

<p>In these two incidents we see the undecided,
perplexing position of the Negro
woman in New York. Today she may be
turned out of a public resort as a "nigger,"
tomorrow she may receive the dues of a
gentlewoman. And since, while I write, I
hear the cry of a class in the community who
adjudge the expulsion necessary since the
other course must lead at once to social
equality, I make haste to add that the second
story did not end in wedlock. As far as I
have seen, it never does. Intermarriage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
white and black in New York is so slight as
to be a negligible quantity, but amalgamation
between the two races is not uncommon.
And this we may say with certainty, the
man most blatant against the "nigger" in
New York as all over the country is the
man most ready to enter into illicit relationship
with the woman whom he claims to
despise. The raising of the hat to the
colored woman brings a diminution in sexual
immorality.</p>

<p>If the Negro civilization of New York is
to be lifted to a higher level, the white race
must consistently play a finer and more
generous part toward the colored woman.
There are many inherent difficulties against
which she must contend. Slavery deprived
her of family life, set her to daily toil in the
field, or appropriated her mother's instincts
for the white child. She has today the
difficult task of maintaining the integrity
and purity of the home. Many times she
has succeeded, often she has failed, sometimes
she has not even tried. A vicious
environment has strengthened her passions
and degraded her from earliest girlhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Beyond any people in the city she needs all
the encouragement that philanthropy, that
human courtesy and respect, that the fellowship
of the workers can give,&mdash;she needs her
full status as a woman.</p>

<p>Of the many nations and races that dwell
in New York none, with the exception of
the Chinese, is so aloof from us in its social
life as the Negro. The childish recollection
of an old school friend, recently related
to me, well illustrates this. Across the way
from where she lived there was a house
occupied by a family of mulattoes. They
were the quietest and least obtrusive people
on the block, and the wife, who was known
to be very beautiful, on the rare occasions
when she left her home, was always veiled.
The husband was little seen, and the child,
a shy boy, never played on the street. For
years the family lived aloof from their
neighbors, the subject of hushed and mysterious
questioning.</p>

<p>Probably had one of the white women
dropped in some day to say good-morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
or to borrow a recipe book, the mystery
would have been wholly dispelled,&mdash;a pity
surely for the children. Few of New York's
citizens are so American as the colored, few
show so little that is unusual or picturesque.
The educated Italian might have in his
home some relic of his former country, the
Jew might show some symbol of his religion;
but the Negro, to the seeker of the
unusual, would seem commonplace. The
colored man in New York has no associations
with his ancient African home, no
African traditions, no folk lore. The days
of slavery he wishes completely to forget,
even to the loss of his exquisite plantation
music. He is ambitious to be conventional
in his manners, his customs, striving as far
as possible to be like his neighbor&mdash;a distinctly
American ambition. In consequence,
after indicating the lines along which he has
achieved economic success, one finds little
to describe in the lives of the well-to-do
that will be of interest. And yet this sketch
would be open to criticism if, after so long
a survey of the working class, it gave no
space to those Negroes who have achieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
a fair degree of wealth and leisure; and perhaps
the very recital of the likeness of these
people to those about them may be of importance,
for the great mass of white Americans
are like a vivacious Kentuckian of my
acquaintance, who, on learning something of
a well-to-do Negro family, assured me that
she knew less of such people than she did
of the Esquimaux.</p>

<p>Mr. William Archer, in his book, "Through
Afro-America," describes a round of visits
to southern Negro homes, where, with touching
pride, his hostesses show their material
wealth, or rather the material wealth of
their race as embodied in drawing-room,
dining-room, and bedroom. There seemed
to be nothing remarkable about the rooms
unless their very existence was remarkable.
So the interiors of colored homes in New
York would reveal nothing to mark them
from the homes of their neighbors, save perhaps
the universal presence of some musical
instrument. In Brooklyn, the Bronx, and
in the Jersey suburbs, Negroes buy and rent
houses, sometimes with a few of their race in
close proximity, sometimes with white neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>bors
only on the block. Brooklyn seems
always to have shown less race antagonism
than Manhattan (where, indeed, anything
but the apartment is beyond the pocket-book
of people of modest means), and it
has been in Brooklyn for the past three
generations that the well-to-do colored families
with their children have chiefly been
found.</p>

<p>Much pleasant hospitality and entertainment
take place behind these modest doors.
Visitors are common, relatives from the east
and west and south, and little dinner and
supper parties are numerous. If church discipline
does not interfere, the women have
their afternoons of whist, and despite church
discipline, dancing is very common, few entertainments
proving successful without it.
To play well upon some musical instrument
is almost a universal accomplishment, and,
as with the Germans, families and friends
meet the oftener for this harmonious bond.</p>

<p>The social life of the well-to-do colored
family generally centres about the church,
and with a regularity unusual among the
white people, father and mother and chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>dren
attend the Sunday and week-day meetings.
Colored society is also at the period
of the bazaar and fair, the concert and
dramatic entertainment. Money is raised
by this means for the church, the private
charity, or to supplement the dues of the
mutual benefit society. There are a number
of Negroes in the different large cities who
support themselves by concerts and readings,
appearing at benefits in the North and
South, where they receive a third or a half of
the receipts. Amateur performances are also
common. A young New York college man,
one winter evening, saw two refined, remarkably
well-dressed colored women turn in at
the entrance of the Grand Central Palace.
Purchasing a ticket for the benefit, as it
proved, of a colored day nursery (the entertainment
netted $2300), he followed them
to find himself in the Afro-American social
world. For while the amateur dancing
and singing upon the stage were pretty
and attractive, the young man was far more
interested in the audience. "And the disappointing
thing about it," he remarked
in telling of it afterwards, "was that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
were exactly like other people." To use the
newspaper phrase, "there was no 'story.'"
They were a group of Americans, trained in
the social conventions of their own land.</p>

<p>There are many secret and benefit societies
among the Negroes in New York.
The Masons have nine meeting places; the
Elks, ten lodges. The Odd Fellows have
twenty-two places of meeting. The United
Order of True Reformers, a strong Negro
organization in the South, where it conducts
large business enterprises, has forty-four
head-quarters in church and hall and
private house, where meetings are held twice
a month. Many benefit societies are closely
associated with the churches. Colored men
and women are very busy with their multitudinous
church and society and benefit
meetings. I remember once attending an
evening service at a colored church when
the minister preached the sermon to the
benefit orders of St. Luke's and the Galilean
Fishermen. The officers, some of them
carrying spears with blue and red and white
trimmings, marched down the aisle and
took their seats at the front of the pulpit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Their leader was in purple, wearing a huge
badge like a breastplate with yellow and
green stones. The women, equally prominent
with the men, were dressed one in
yellow with green over it, and broad purple
bands, two in white with golden crowns.
The pageant was very pretty, even beautiful,
but too artless in its simple enjoyment
of color and display for the conventional
society of New York, and the colored "four
hundred" were not in it.</p>

<p>Who are the four hundred in New York's
colored society? An outsider would be
very bold who should attempt to answer.
Twenty-five years ago the New Yorker born,
especially the descendant of some prominent
anti-slavery worker, would have held foremost
social position. The taint of slavery
was far removed from these people, who
looked with scorn upon arrivals from the
South. Many were proud of their Indian
blood, and told of the freedom that came
to their black ancestors who married Long
Island Indians. But these old New York
colored families, sometimes bearing historic
Dutch and English names, have diminished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
in size and importance as have the old white
families beside them. The younger generation
has gone west, or has died and left
no issue. And into the city has come a
continual stream of Southerners and more
recently West Indians, some among them
educated, ambitious men and women, full
of the energy and determination of the
immigrant who means to attain to prominence
in his new home. These new-comers
occupy many of the pulpits, are admitted
to the bar, practise medicine, and become
leaders in politics, and their wives are quite
ready to take a prominent part in the social
world. They meet the older residents, and
the various groups intermingle, though not
without some friction. Like a country village,
the New York Negro social world
knows the happenings of its neighbors,
gossips over their shortcomings, rejoices,
though with something of jealousy, over
their successes, and has its cliques, its many
leaders, but also its broad-minded spirits
who strive to bring the whole village life
into harmony.</p>

<p>As we have learned from a study of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
occupational life of the Negro, the majority
of men and women of means are in the
professional class, or in the city or federal
service. Such positions do not carry with
them large incomes, and remembering the
high cost of living in New York, and the
exorbitant rental paid by black men, we
can see that, gauged by the white man's
standard, the Negro with his two or three or
four thousand dollars a year is poor. Yet
with his very limited income the demands
upon him are enormous. In the first place,
he must educate his children, and this means
a large expenditure, for only in the technical
schools or the college can his boy or girl be
prepared for a successful career. The white
boy may find some business firm that will
give him a chance of advancement, but the
colored boy must receive such an education
as shall fit him to start an enterprise
by himself, unless he enters public service.
So the trade or professional school or college
absorbs the savings of many years.</p>

<p>The church is another large recipient of
the Negro's slender means. Watching the
dimes and quarters drop into the contribu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>tion
plate as the dark-faced congregation
files past the pulpit on a Sunday evening,
one wonders whether any other people in
America willingly give so large an amount
of their income to their religious organizations.
And not only will money be requested
for the church's need, but special offerings
will be given to home and foreign mission
work. In 1907, the African Methodist
Church alone raised $36,000 for home and foreign
missions. The Baptists raised $44,000.
Educational work demands a share: the African
Methodists support twenty schools, the
African Zion twelve, and the Negro Baptists
one hundred and twenty. The other denominations
do their share, and the Negroes
also give to the schools conducted by white
churches for their people. This money comes
from all over the country, and the well-to-do
New York Negro must contribute his part.</p>

<p>Home charities also help to drain the
Negro's purse. Manhattan and Brooklyn
have a number of colored philanthropies,
orphan asylums, old people's homes, rescue
missions, Young Men's and Young Women's
Christian Associations, and social settlements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Some are supported entirely by white people,
but the greater number receive some contributions
from the colored, and a few are
dependent for money upon that race alone.
Thousands of dollars are raised yearly,
among the well-to-do New York Negroes,
for these institutions.</p>

<p>Yet, with all these various philanthropic
activities, one too frequently hears that the
Negro does not support his own charities.
As though anything of the sort could be
expected of him! A little time ago, in
asking for money for settlement work among
Negroes, I was asked in turn by the exquisitely
dressed woman before me, whose furs
and gown and jewels must have represented
a year's salary of a school-teacher, the type
of wealthy woman among the colored, why
the well-to-do Negroes did not support the
settlement themselves. No such question
is asked when we demand money for work
among the Italians or the Jews, who have
incomparably larger means. Indeed, one
may question whether the Negro is not too
generous for the materialistic city of New
York, whether his successes would not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
greater were he niggardly toward himself
and others. He lives well, dresses well,
enjoys a good play, strives to give every
advantage to his children, helps the poor of
his race. To hold his own today in this
civilization, he needs to be taught to seek
first riches, waiting until much treasure has
been laid up before he allows philanthropy
to draw upon his bank account.</p>

<p>The traveller to the British West Indies
finds three divisions among the inhabitants,
white, colored, and black, each group having
a distinct social status. In the United
States, on the other hand, there are but two
groups, white and colored, or as the latter
is now more frequently designated, Negro,
the term thus losing its original meaning,
and becoming a designation for a race.
But while the white race usually makes no
social distinction between the light and the
dark Negro, classing all alike, social lines
are drawn within the color line. Years
ago these were more common than they are
now. Charles W. Chesnutt, the novelist,
tells some amusing and pathetic stories of
distinctions between colored and black. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of his mulatto heroes, upon finding, as he
thinks, that the congressman who is to call
upon his daughter is a jet black Negro instead
of the mulatto he was supposed to be,
to prevent a breach of hospitality, invents a
case of diphtheria in the family and quarantines
the house, only to learn later, to his
intense mortification, that he has committed
a mistake of identification, and that the
congressman is light after all. But this
story belongs with the last generation.
Black men, if they are distinguished citizens,
can enter any colored society, and they not
infrequently marry light wives. Success, a
position of probity and importance, these
are attributes that count favorably for the
suitor, and as they are quite as often in
the man of strong African lineage as in the
mulatto, they gain the desired end.</p>

<p>Within this little colored world of a few
thousand souls, a drop in the city's human
sea, there is great upheaval and turmoil.
The North is the Negro's centre for controversy
regarding his rightful position in the
commonwealth; and in the large cities, in
Boston and Chicago, Philadelphia and New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
York, the battle rages. The little society is
often divided into hostile camps regarding
party politics or the acceptance of a government
position that brings the suspicion
of a bribe. Political, economic, educational
matters as they affect the black race, these
are the subjects that fill the mind of the
thoughtful colored man and woman.</p>

<p>In his "Souls of Black Folk," Dr. Du Bois
describes the white man's tactlessness when,
as always, he approaches the Negro with a
question regarding his race. But the Negro,
apart from his personal home affairs, impresses
the outsider as having little else as
subject for conversation. World politics,
these concern him only as they affect the
race question. Australia is a country where
the government excludes Africans. England
rules in South Africa and has lately recognized
the right of African disfranchisement.
Germany in Africa is cruel to black men.
The Latin people know no color line. At
home, the conflict of capital and labor is
important as the Negro wins or loses in the
economic struggle; the enfranchisement of
woman is wise or unwise as it would affect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Negro enfranchisement, one colored thinker
arguing against it since it would double the
white vote in the South where the Negro has
no political rights; literature is the poetry
of Dunbar, the writing of Washington and
Du Bois, the literature of the Negro question,
and art is largely comprised in Tanner's
paintings.</p>

<p>This picture should not imply that the
colored people of means are without the
possibility of wide culture and sympathy.
They are perhaps more sympathetic by
nature than the white people about them.
But each year, as the white American grows
increasingly conscious of race, as he argues
on racial differences, the Negro feels his
dark face, is sensitive to every disdainful
look, and separates himself from the people
about him and their problems.</p>

<p>There is a struggle against this. The
majority of white people have heard, in a
vague way, that there is a difference of
opinion in the Negro world; and again,
vaguely, that it takes the form of opposition
to Dr. Booker T. Washington and industrial
training. But the difference of opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
among the Negroes is a difference of ideals,
and reaches far beyond the controversy of
industrial or cultural training, or the question
of individual leadership. It is difficult
to formulate, inasmuch as few, if any,
Negroes hold logically to one ideal wholly
to the exclusion of the other. They cannot
be logical and live. But their division into
radical and conservative is too important to
omit; especially since, as we have seen, there
is nothing in their social life to distinguish
them from their neighbors; only in their
thoughts are they aloof from us&mdash;aliens
upon whose shoulders is the problem of a
race.</p>

<p>How can one explain these two ideals?
Roughly, they accept or reject segregation.
The first looks upon the black man in America,
for many generations at least, as a race
apart. Recognizing this, the race must increasingly
grow in self-efficiency. It must
run its own businesses, own its banks, its
groceries, its restaurants, have its dressmakers,
milliners, tailors; it must establish
factories where it shall employ only colored
men and women; its children shall be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
into the world by colored doctors, taught by
colored teachers, buried by colored undertakers.
Education, along industrial lines,
shall help train the worker to this efficiency,
and a proper race pride shall give him the
patronage of the Negroes about him. When,
as will of course happen in the majority of
cases, the Negro works for the white man,
he must consider himself and his race. He
must not go out on strike when the white
man strives for higher wages; he is justified,
if he is willing to risk a broken head, in
filling the place of the striking workman, for
he has to look after his own concerns.</p>

<p>The second point of view resists segregation.
It believes that the Negro should
never cease to struggle against being treated
as a race apart, that he should demand the
privileges of a citizen, free access to all
public institutions, full civil and political
rights. As a workman, he should have the
opportunity of other workmen, his training
should be the training of his white neighbor,
and in business and the professions he should
strive to serve white as well as black. And
just as in the battle-field he fights in a com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>mon
cause with his white comrade, so in the
struggle for better working class conditions
he should stand by the side of the laborer,
regardless of race. Believing these things
and finding that America fails to meet his
demands, he thinks it should be his part to
struggle for his ideal, vigorously to protest
against discrimination, and never, complacent,
to submit to the position of inferiority.</p>

<p>As I have said, few men hold logically to
either of these ideals, and as that of acquiescence
to present conditions is naturally
popular with the whites, who are themselves
responsible for discrimination, material success
sometimes means a departure from the
aggressive to the submissive attitude. However,
the whole question of the Negro as a
wage earner is yet scarcely understood by
this small professional and business class.
They are in turmoil, in a virile struggle,
harsh, bewildering, baffling.</p>

<p>"I cannot conceive what it would mean
not to be a Negro," a prominent New York
colored man once said to me. "The white
people think and feel so little; their life
lacks an absorbing interest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<p>This is the characteristic fact of the life
of the well-to-do Negro in New York. He
is not permitted to go through the city streets
in easy comfort of body or mind. Some
personal rebuff, some harsh word in newspaper
or magazine, quickens his pulse and
rouses him from the lethargy that often
overtakes his comfortable white neighbor.
Looking into the past of slavery, watching
the coming generation, the most careless of
heart is forced into serious questioning. A
comfortable income and the intelligence to
enjoy the culture of a great city do not bring
to the Negro any smug self-satisfaction; only
a greater responsibility toward the problem
that moves through the world with his dark
face.</p>

<p>Before turning to our last topic, the Negro
and the Municipality, we ought to note two
further characteristics of the Negro in New
York.</p>

<p>There are certain statistics quoted by
every writer upon the Negro, statistics of
mortality and crime. We have noted these
for the child, but not as yet for the Negroes
as a whole. They have been left until this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
point in our study that we may view them
in relation to what we have learned of the
Negro's economic condition and his environment.</p>

<p>Looking for criminal statistics first, we
find them difficult to obtain in New York.
The courts' reports do not classify by color,
but we can learn something from the census
enumeration of 1904 of the prisoners in the
New York County Penitentiary and the New
York County Workhouse. These are short
term offenders sent up from the city of New
York. The enumeration is as follows:</p>

<p>In view of the proportion of Negroes to
whites in Manhattan, two per cent, we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the percentage of colored prisoners high, but
no higher than we expect when we remember
that the Negro occupies the lowest plane in
the industrial community, "the plane which
everywhere supplies the jail, the penitentiary,
the gallows."<a name="FNanchor_56_1" id="FNanchor_56_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But the very large
percentage of crime among colored women
calls for grave consideration. In the workhouse,
imprisoned for fighting, for drunkenness,
for prostitution, the colored women
more than double in number the colored
men. Here is a condition that we noted
in the Children's Court records: an unduly
large percentage of disorderly and depraved
colored female offenders.</p>

<p>We have already touched upon the subject
of morality among colored women. Various
causes, some of which we have noted, go to
the making up of this high percentage of
crime. The Negroes themselves believe the
basic cause to be their recent enslavement
with its attendant unstable marriage and
parental status. They point to the centuries
of healthful home relationships among Amer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>icans
and Europeans, and contrast them with
the thousands upon thousands of yearly
sales of slaves that but two generations ago
disrupted the Negro's attempts at family
life. With this heritage they believe that
it is inevitable that numbers of their women
should be slow to recognize the sanctity of
home and the importance of feminine virtue.</p>

<p>The mortality figures for the New York
Negro are more striking than the figures for
crime. In 1908 the death rate for whites in
the city was 16.6 in every thousand; for
colored (including Chinese), 28.9, almost
double the white rate. The Negroes' greatest
excess over the white was in tuberculosis,
congenital debility, and venereal diseases as
the table on the following page shows.</p>

<p>The Negro's inherent weakness, his inability
to resist disease, is a favorite topic
today with writers on the color question.
A high mortality is indeed a matter for grave
concern, but we may question whether these
figures show inherent weakness. If a new
disease attacks any group of people, it causes
terrible decimation, and tuberculosis and
venereal diseases, the white man's plagues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
have proved terribly destructive to the black
man. But recalling the conditions under
which the great majority of the colored race
lives in New York, the long hours of labor,
the crowded rooms, the insufficient food, we
find abundant cause for a high death rate.
For poverty and death go hand in hand, and
the proportion of Negroes in New York who,
live in great poverty far exceeds the proportion
of whites.<a name="FNanchor_57_2" id="FNanchor_57_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The students at Hampton Institute sing
an old plantation song that runs like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"If religion was a thing that money could buy,<br />
The rich would live and the poor would die.<br />
But my good Lord has fixed it so<br />
The rich and the poor together must go."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of our rich men seem to have fixed
it with religion to escape from the condition
the poem describes, but it depicts a reality
in the Negro's life. Rich and poor, as we
saw when we left our old New Yorkers,
competent and inefficient, pure and diseased,
good and bad, all go together. Much of the
recent literature written by Negroes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
especially that by Dr. Booker T. Washington,
attempts to separate in the minds of the
community the thrifty and prosperous colored
men from the helpless and degraded;
but the effort meets with a limited success.
When we can have a statistical study of
some thousands of the well-to-do Negroes
compared with an equal number of well-to-do
whites, we may find striking similarity.
From my own observations I find that the
well-to-do Negroes bear and rear children,
refrain from committing crimes that put
them into jail, and live to an old age with
the same success as their white neighbors.
But they get little credit for it. Willy-nilly,
the strong, intellectual Negro is linked
to his unfortunate fellow. Whether an increase
in material prosperity will break this
bond, or whether it will continue until it
ceases to be a bond as humanity comes into
its own, is a secret of the future. For today
the song rings true, and the rich and the
poor go together.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Negro and the Municipality</span></h2>


<p>A capricious mood, varying with the
individual, considerate today and offensive
tomorrow, this, as far as our observations
have led us, has been New York's attitude
toward the Negro. Is it possible to find any
principle underlying this shifting position?
The city expresses itself through the individual
actions of its changing four millions
of people, but also through its government,
its courts of justice, its manifold public
activities. Out of these various manifestations
of the community's spirit can we find a
Negro policy? Has New York any principle
of conduct toward these her colored citizens?
This question should be worth our consideration,
for New York's attitude means its
environmental influence, and helps determine
for the newly arrived immigrant and the
growing generation whether justice or intol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>erance
shall mark their dealings with the
black race.</p>

<p>The first matter of civic importance to the
Negro, as to every other New York resident,
is his position in the commonwealth; is he a
participant in the government under which
he lives, or a subject without political rights?
The law since 1873 has been explicit on this
matter, wiping out former property qualifications,
and giving full manhood suffrage.
Probably, even with a much larger influx
of colored people, the city will never agitate
this question again. Since the death of the
Know-nothing Party, New York has ceased
any organized attempt to lessen the power
of the foreigner, and the growing cosmopolitan
character of the population strengthens
the Negro in his rights. Only in those states
where the white population is homogeneous
can Negro disfranchisement successfully take
place.</p>

<p>With the vote the Negro has entered into
politics and has maintained successful political
organizations. The necessity of paying
for rent and food out of eight or ten dollars
a week is the Negro's immediate issue in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
New York, and he tries to meet it by securing
a congenial and more lucrative job. The
city in 1910 showed some consideration for
him in this matter. An Assistant District
Attorney and an Assistant Corporation Counsel
were colored, and scattered throughout
the city departments were nine clerks making
from $1200 to $1800 apiece, and a dozen
more acting as messengers, inspectors, drivers,
attendants, receiving salaries averaging
$1275. Three doctors served the Board of
Health, and there were six men on the police
force (none given patrol duty), and one first
grade fireman, while the departments of
docks, parks, street cleaning, and water supply
employed 470 colored laborers. Altogether
511 colored men figure among the
city's employees.<a name="FNanchor_58_1" id="FNanchor_58_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In her communal gifts the city acts toward
the Negro with a fair degree of impartiality.
At the public schools and libraries, the parks
and playgrounds, the baths, hospitals, and,
last, the almshouse, the blacks have equal
rights with the whites. Occasionally indi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>vidual
public servants show color prejudice,
but again, occasionally, especial kindness
attends the black child. The rude treatment
awaiting them, however, from other
visitors keeps many Negro children, and
men and women, from enjoying the city's
benefactions. Particularly is this true with
the public baths and with some of the playgrounds.
The employment by the city of
at least one colored official in every neighborhood
where the Negroes are in great
numbers would do much to remedy this
condition.</p>

<p>One department of the city might be cited
as having been an exception to the rule of
reasonably fair treatment to the colored
man. Harshness, for no cause but his black
face, has been too frequently bestowed upon
the Negro by the police. This has been
especially noticeable in conflicts between
white and colored, when the white officer,
instead of dealing impartially with offenders,
protected his own race.</p>

<p>There have been two conflicts between the
whites and Negroes in New York in recent
years, the first in 1900, on the West Side, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the forties, the second in 1905, on San Juan
Hill. Each riot was local, representing no
wide-spread excitement comparable to the
draft riots of 1863, and in each case the police
might easily in the beginning have stopped all
fighting. Instead, they showed themselves
ready to aid, even to instigate the conflict.</p>

<p>The riot of 1900 was caused by the death
of a policeman at the hands of a Negro.
The black man declared that he was defending
his life, but the officer was popular, and
after his funeral riots began. Black men ran
to the police for protection, and were thrown
back by them into the hands of the mob.<a name="FNanchor_59_2" id="FNanchor_59_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The riot of 1905 commenced on San Juan
Hill one Friday evening in July with a
fracas between a colored boy and a white
peddler; both races took a hand in the matter
until the side streets showed a rough scrambling
fight. Saturday and Sunday were
comparatively quiet; men, black and white,
stood on street corners and scowled at one
another, but nothing further need have
occurred, had each race been treated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
justice. The police, however, instead of
keeping the peace, angered the Negroes,
urged on their enemies, and by Monday
night found that they had helped create a
riot, this time bitter and dangerous. Overzealous
to proceed against the "niggers,"
officers rushed into places frequented by
peaceable colored men, whom they placed
under arrest. Dragging their victims to the
station-house they beat them so unmercifully
that before long many needed to be
handed over to another city department&mdash;the
hospital. Little question was made as
to guilt or innocence, and some of the worst
offenders, colored as well as white, were
never brought to justice.<a name="FNanchor_60_3" id="FNanchor_60_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "If," as a colored
preacher whose church was the centre of the
storm district pointed out, "the police
would only differentiate between the good
and the bad Negroes, and not knock on the
head every colored man they saw in a riot,
we should be quite satisfied. As it is, there
is no safety for any Negro in this part of the
city at any time."<a name="FNanchor_61_4" id="FNanchor_61_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>
<p>The result of these two riots was the bringing
to justice of one policeman and the
placing of a humane and tactful captain on
San Juan Hill. But for some time the colored
man felt little protection in the Department
of Police, finding that he was liable to arrest
and clubbing for a trivial offence. Often
the officer's club fell with cruel force. This,
however, was before the administration of
Mayor Gaynor, who has commanded humane
treatment, and the brutal clubbing of the
New York Negro has now ceased.</p>

<p>From the police one turns naturally to the
courts. What is their attitude toward the
Negro offender? Is there any race prejudice,
or do black and white enjoy an impartial and
judicial hearing?</p>

<p>As the Negro comes before the magistrates
of the city courts, he learns to know that
judges differ greatly in their conceptions of
justice. To the Southerner, let us say from
Richmond, where the black man is arrested
for small offences and treated with considerable
roughness and harshness, New York
courts seem lenient.<a name="FNanchor_62_5" id="FNanchor_62_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> To the West Indian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
accustomed to British rule, justice in New
York is noticeable for its variability, the
likelihood that if it is severe tonight, it will
be generous tomorrow.</p>

<p>"Three months," the listener at court
hears given as sentence to a respectable-looking
colored servant girl who has begged
to be allowed to return to her place which
she has held for five years. "I never was
up for drinking before," she pleads; "I have
learnt my lesson; please give me a chance;
I will not do this again."</p>

<p>"What should you two be fighting for?"
another judge, another morning, says to two
very battered women, one white and one
colored, who come before him in court.
And talking kindly to both, but with greater
seriousness to the Irish offender, his own
countrywoman, he sends them away with a
reprimand.</p>

<p>How much of this unequal treatment comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
from color prejudice or caprice or temperament,
the Negro is unable to decide, but he
soon learns one curious fact: while his black
skin marks him as inheriting Republican
politics, it is the Democratic magistrate, the
Tammany henchman whose name is a byword
to the righteous, who is the more
lenient when he has committed a trifling
offence.</p>

<p>"Didn't I play craps with the nigger boys
when I was a kid?" one of these well-known
politicians says, "and am I going back on
the poor fellows now?" Of course, the
Negro is assured such men only want his
vote, but he believes real sympathy actuates
the Tammany leader, who is too busy to
bother whether the man before him is black
or white. The reformer, on the other hand,
big with dignity, at times makes him vastly
uncomfortable as he lectures upon the Negro
problem from the eminence of the superior
race.</p>

<p>But whether Republican or Democrat, the
Negro learns that it is well to have a friend
at court; that helplessness is the worst of all
disabilities, worse than darkness of skin or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
poverty. So he soon becomes acquainted
with his local politician, and if his friend is
in trouble, or his wife or son is locked up,
pounds vigorously at the politician's door.
It may be midnight, but the man of power
will dress, and together they will turn from
the dark tenement hall into the lighted street
and on to the police-station or magistrate's
court to seek release for the offender. That
too often the gravity of the offence weighs
little in the securing of lenient treatment is
part of the muddle of New York justice.
The Negro finds that he has taken the most
direct way to secure relief.</p>

<p>As far as we have followed, we have found
the municipality of New York generally
ready to treat her black citizens with the
same justice or injustice with which she
treats her whites. Exceptions occur, but she
does not often draw the color line. Perhaps,
in this connection, it might be well to stop
a moment and see what return the black
man makes, whether by his vote he helps
secure to the city honest and efficient government.</p>

<p>Walking through a Negro quarter on elec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>tion
day, the most careful search fails to reveal
any such far-sighted altruism. With a
great majority of colored voters the choice of
a municipal candidate is based on the argument
of a two-dollar bill or the promise of a
job, combined with the sentiment, decreasing
every year, for the Republican Party&mdash;the
party that once helped the colored man
and, he hopes, may help him again. The
public standing of the mayoralty candidate,
his ability to choose wise heads of departments,
the building of new subways, the
ownership of public utilities, these are unimportant
issues. The matter of immediate
moment is what this vote is going to
mean to the black voter himself.</p>

<p>Such a selfish and unpatriotic attitude,
not unknown perhaps to white voters, leads
some of our writers and reformers to doubt
the value of universal manhood suffrage.
Mr. Ray Stannard Baker tells us that the
Negro and the poor white in New York,
through their venality, are practically without
a vote. "While the South is disfranchising
by legislation," he says, "the North
is doing it by cash." "What else is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
meaning of Tammany Hall and the boss
and machine system in other cities?"<a name="FNanchor_63_6" id="FNanchor_63_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> New
York's noted ethical culture teacher argues
against agitation for woman's suffrage on
the ground that so many of those who now
have the vote do not know how to use it.
But looking closely at these unaltruistic citizens,
we see that after all they are putting
the ballot to its primary use, the protection
of their own interests. The Negro in New
York has one vital need, steady, decent work.
He dickers and plays with politics to get as
much of this as he can. It is very insufficient
relief for an intolerable situation, but
it is partial relief. In another city, Atlanta
for instance, he might find education the
most important civic gift for which to strive.
Atlanta is a fortunate city to choose for an
example of the power of the suffrage, for
since the Negro's loss of the vote in Georgia,
educational funds have been turned chiefly
to white schools, and 5,000 colored children
are without opportunities for public education.
1885 saw the last school building
erected for Negroes, the result of a bargain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
between the colored voters and the prohibitionists.<a name="FNanchor_64_7" id="FNanchor_64_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Should a colored teacher in New
York be refused her certificate, a colored
consumptive be denied a place in the city's
hospital, a colored child meet with a rebuff
in the city park, the colored citizen would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
find his vote an important means of redress.
Then, too, while there are so many men to
buy, it is important to have a vote to sell,
lest the other citizens secure the morning's
bargains. Venality in high and low places
will not disappear until we are dominated
by the ideal of social, not individual advancement.
Before that time, it is well for the
weak that they are able, at least in the
political field, to bargain with the strong.</p>

<p>The importance to the Negro of the vote
is quickly appreciated when we consider New
York's attitude unofficially expressed. With
the franchise behind him the colored man
can secure for himself and his children
the municipality's advantages of education,
health, amusement, philanthropy. He is
here a citizen, a contributor to the city
treasury, if not directly as a taxpayer, as a
worker and renter. But as a private individual,
seeking to use the utilities managed
by other private individuals, he continually
encounters race discrimination. Private
doors are closed, and were the state not so
wealthy and generous, disabilities still graver
than at present would follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p>A few examples will show the condition.
A Negro applies by letter for admission to
an automobile school, and is accepted; but
on appearing with his fee his color debars
his entrance. Carrying the case to court,
the complaint is dismissed on the ground
that the law which forbade exclusion from
places of education on account of race
and color is applicable only to public
schools. Private institutions may do as
they desire.</p>

<p>Again, a colored man tries to get a meal.
At the first restaurant he is told that all
the tables are engaged; at the next no one
will serve him. Fearful of further rebuffs,
he has to turn to the counter of a railway
station. He wants to go to the theatre.
Like Tommy Atkins, he is sent to the gallery
or round the music halls. The white barber
whose shop he enters will not shave him;
and when night comes, he searches a long
time before the hotel appears that will give
him a bed. The sensitive man, still more
the sensitive woman, often finds the city's
attitude difficult to endure.</p>

<p>American Negroes have become familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
with racial lines, but the foreigner of African
descent, a visitor to the city, meets with
rebuffs that fill him with surprise as well as
rage. Haytians and South Americans, men
of continental education and wide culture,
have been ordered away as "niggers" from
restaurant doors, and at the box office of
the theatre refused an orchestra seat. English
Negroes from the West Indies, men and
women of character and means, learn that
New York is a spot to be avoided, and cross
the ocean when they wish to taste of city
life. In short, the stranger of Negro descent,
if he be rash of temper, hurls anathemas at
the villainously mannered Americans; or, if
he be good-natured, shrugs his shoulders and
counts New York a provincial settlement of
four million people.</p>

<p>Northern Negroes believe this discrimination
in public places against the black man
to be increasing in New York. One, who
came here fifteen years ago, tells of the simple
and adequate test by which he learned that
he had reached the northern city. Born in
South Carolina, as he attained manhood he
desired larger self-expression, broader human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
relations&mdash;he wanted "to be free," as he
again and again expressed it. So leaving
the cotton fields he started one morning
to walk to New York. After a number of
days he entered a large city and, uncertain
in his geography, decided that this was his
journey's end. "I'll be free here," he
thought, and opening the door of a brightly
lighted restaurant started to walk in. The
white men at the tables looked up in
astonishment, and the proprietor, laying his
hand on the youth's shoulder, invited him,
in strong southern accent, to go into the
kitchen. "I reckon I'm not North yet," the
Negro said, smiling a bright, boyish smile.
Interested in his visitor's appearance, the
proprietor took him into another room, gave
him a good supper, and talked with him far
into the night, urging the advantages of his
staying in the South. But the youth shook
his head, and the next morning trudged on.
At length he reached a rushing city, tumultuous
with humanity, and entering an eating-house
was served a meal. To him it was
almost a sacrament. He belonged not to a
race but to humanity. He tasted the freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
of passing unnoticed. But it is doubtful
if the same restaurant would serve him
today.</p>

<p>Color lines, on these matters of entertainment
as on others, are not hard and fast. A
few hotels, chiefly those frequented by Latin
<a name="tn3" id="tn3"></a>people, receive colored guests; and while
the foreign Negro meets with rudeness, he
is rebuffed less than the native. "I can't
get into that place as a southern darky," a
black man laughingly says, pointing to a
fashionable restaurant, "I'll be the Prince
of Abyssinia." But as Prince or American
his status is shifting and uncertain; here,
preeminently, he is half a man.</p>

<p>Discrimination against any man because of
his color is contrary to the law of the state.
After the fifteenth amendment became a
law, New York passed a civil rights bill,
which as it stands, re-enacted in 1909, is
very explicit. All persons within the jurisdiction
of the state are entitled to the accommodation
of hotels, restaurants, theatres,
music halls, barbers' shops, and any person
refusing such accommodation is subject to
civil and penal action. The offence may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
be punished by fine or imprisonment or
both.<a name="FNanchor_65_8" id="FNanchor_65_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In 1888, the attempt to exclude three
colored men from a skating-rink at Binghamton,
N. Y., led to a suit against the owner
of the rink, and his conviction. The case<a name="FNanchor_66_9" id="FNanchor_66_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
reached the Court of Appeals, where the
constitutionality of the civil rights bill
was upheld. "It is evident," said Justice
Andrews in his decision, "that to exclude
colored people from places of public resort
on account of their race is to fix upon them
a brand of inferiority, and tends to fix their
position as a servile and dependent people."</p>

<p>But despite the law and precedent, the
civil rights bill is violated in New York.
Occasionally colored men bring suit, but the
magistrate dismisses the complaint. Usually
the evidence is declared insufficient. A case
of a colored man refused orchestra seats at
a theatre is dismissed on the ground that
not the proprietor but his employees turned
the man away. A keeper of an ice-cream
parlor, wishing to prevent the colored man
from patronizing him, charges a Negro a
dollar for a ten-cent plate. The customer
pays the dollar, keeps the check, and brings
the case to court. Ice-cream parlors are
then declared not to come under the list of
places of public entertainment and amusement.
A bootblack refuses to polish the
shoes of a Negro, and the court decides that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
a bootblack-stand is not a place of public
accommodation, and refusal to shine the
shoes of a colored man does not subject its
proprietor to the penalties imposed by the
law.<a name="FNanchor_67_10" id="FNanchor_67_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This last case was carried to the
Court of Appeals, and the adverse judgment
has led many of the thoughtful colored men
of the city to doubt the value of attempting to
push a civil rights suit. Litigation is expensive,
and money spent in any personal rights
case that attacks private business, whether
the plaintiff be white or colored, is usually
wasted. The civil rights law is on the books,
and the psychological moment may arrive
to insist successfully on its enforcement.</p>

<p>If there is an increase in discrimination
against the Negro in New York solely because
of his color, it is a serious matter to
the city as well as to the race. Every community
has its social conscience built up of
slowly accumulated experiences, and it cannot
without disaster lose its ideal of justice
or generosity. New York has never been tender
to its people, but it has a rough hospitality,
what Stevenson describes as "uncivil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
kindness," and welcomes new-comers with a
friendly shove, bidding them become good
Americans. After the war, the Negro entered
more than formerly into this general
welcome. He was unnoticed, allowed to go
his way without questioning word or stare,
the position which every right-minded man
and woman desires. But today New York
has become conscious that he is dark-skinned,
and her attitude affects her growing children.
"I never noticed colored people," an old
abolitionist said to me, "I never realized
there were white and black until, when a boy
of twelve, I entered a church and found
Negroes occupying seats alone in the gallery."
As New York returns to the gallery
seats, her boys and girls return to consciousness
of color and, from fisticuffs at school,
move on to the race riots upon the streets
with bullets among the stones.</p>

<p>The municipality, as we have seen, treats
the Negro on the whole with justice; its
standard is higher than the standard of the
average citizen. It cherishes the ideal of democracy,
and strives for impartiality toward
its many nationalities and races. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
New York Negro in his turn does not
allow his liberties to be tampered with without
protest. But the New York citizen can
hardly be described as friendly to the Negro.
What catholicity he has is negative. He
fails to give the black man a hearty welcome.
"Do you know where I stayed the four
weeks of my first trip abroad?" a colored
clergyman once asked me. I refused to make
a guess. "Well," he said a little shamefacedly,
"it was in Paris. Paris may be
a wicked city&mdash;any city has wickedness if
you want to look for it&mdash;but I found it a
place of kindliness and good-will. Every one
seemed glad to be courteous, to assist me in
my stumbling French, to show me the way
on omnibus or boat, or through the difficult
streets. It was so different from America;
I was never wanted in the southern city of
my youth. In Paris I was welcome."</p>

<p>"How is it in New York?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In New York?" He stopped to consider.
"In New York I am tolerated."</p>

of Athens was planning to inaugurate a public school system,
and also wished to 'go dry.' It made a proposal to the colored
voters promising that if their combined vote would
carry the city, two schools should be built, of equal size and
similar structure for each race. I visited Athens shortly after
the two buildings were built, and I found two beautiful brick
buildings very similar in all their appointments. At an interval
of several years I again visited the little city and again
spent an hour in the same brick school-house of the colored
folk.
</p>
<p>
"At my third visit, I found my colored friends occupying
a wooden structure on the edge of the city, and not only inconveniently
located, but much less of a building than the one
hitherto occupied. Upon inquiry I found that in the growth
of the school population of the whites, it was cheaper to seize
the building formerly occupied by the colored children, and to
build for them a cheap wooden structure on the outskirts of
the town.
</p>
<p>
"The colored school was still occupying this inadequate
building at my visit this last September, 1909. A second
wooden structure has been added to the colored equipment
on the east side of the town."
</p>
<p>
This story of the Athenians well illustrates what will be
done when the Negro counts for something politically, and
also what may be undone if his value as a political asset is
reduced.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<span class="smcap">Conclusion</span></h2>


<p>A new little boy came two years ago into
our story-book world. When Miss North,
taking Ezekiel by the hand, led him into her
school-room,<a name="FNanchor_68_1" id="FNanchor_68_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> we met a child full of what we
call temperament; dreaming quaint stories,
innocently friendly, anxious to please for
affection's sake, in his queer, unconscious
way something of a genius. We saw his
big musing eyes looking out upon a world in
which his teacher stood serene and reasoning,
but a little cold like her name; his friend,
Miss Jane, kind and very practical; his employer,
Mr. Rankin, amused and contemptuous;
all watching him with the impersonal
interest with which one might view a new
species in the animal world. For Ezekiel,
unlike our other story-book boys, had a
double being, he was first Ezekiel Jordan, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
little black boy, and second, a Representative
of the Negro Race.</p>

<p>Ezekiel was too young to understand his
position, but the white world about him
never forgot it. When he arrived late to
school, he was a dilatory representative;
when, obliging little soul, he promised three
people to weed their gardens all the same
afternoon, he was a prevaricating representative.
He never happened to steal ice-cream
from the hoky-poky man or to play
hookey, but if he had, he would have been
a thieving and lazy representative. Always
he was something remote and overwhelming,
not a natural growing boy.</p>

<p>Ezekiel's position is that of each Negro
child and man and woman in the United
States today. I think we have seen this as
we have reviewed the position of the race
in New York; indeed, the very fact of our
attempting such a review is patent that
we see and feel it. We white Americans
do not generalize concerning ourselves, we
individualize, leaving generalizations to the
chance visitor, but we generalize continually
concerning colored Americans; we classify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and measure and pass judgment, a little
more with each succeeding year.</p>

<p>Now if we are going to do this, let us be
fair; let us try as much as possible to dismiss
prejudice, and to look at the Ezekiels entering
our school of life, with the same impartiality
and the same understanding sympathy
with which we look upon our own race.
And if we are to place them side by side with
the whites, let us be impartial, not cheating
them out of their hard-earned credits, or
condemning them with undue severity. Let
us try, if we can, to be just.</p>

<p>When we begin to make this effort to
judge fairly our colored world, we need to
remember especially two things: First, that
we cannot yet measure with any accuracy
the capability of the colored man in the
United States, because he has not yet been
given the opportunity to show his capability.
If we deny full expression to a race, if we
restrict its education, stifle its intellectual
and sthetic impulses, we make it impossible
fairly to gauge its ability. Under these circumstances
to measure its achievements with
the more favored white race is unreasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
and unjust, as unreasonable as to measure
against a man's a disfranchised woman's
capabilities in directing the affairs of a state.<a name="FNanchor_69_2" id="FNanchor_69_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The second thing is difficult for us to
remember, difficult for us at first to believe;
that we, dominant, ruling Americans, may
not be the persons best fitted to judge the
Negro. We feel confident that we are, since
we have known him so long and are so
familiar with his peculiarities; but in moments
of earnest reflection may it not occur
to us that we have not the desire or the
imagination to enter into the life emotions
of others? "We are the intellect and virtue
of the airth, the cream of human natur', and
the flower of moral force," Hannibal Chollup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
still says, and glowers at the stranger who
dares to suggest a different standard from
his own. Hannibal Chollup and his ilk are
ill-fitted to measure the refinements of feeling,
the differences in ideals among people.</p>

<p>This question of our fitness to sit in the
judgment seat must come with grave insistence
when we read carefully the literature
published in this city of New York within
the past two years. Our writers have assumed
such pomposity, have so revelled in
what Mr. Chesterton calls "the magnificent
buttering of one's self all over with the same
stale butter; the big defiance of small enemies,"
as to make their conclusions ridiculous.
Ezekiel entering their school is at
once pushed to the bottom of the class, while
the white boy at the head, Hannibal Chollup's
descendant, sings a jubilate of his own
and butters himself so copiously as to be
as shiny as his English cousin, Wackford
Squeers. Then the writer, the judge, begins.
Ezekiel is shown as the incorrigible
boy of the school. He is a lazy, good-for-nothing
vagabond. Favored with the chance
to exercise his muscles twelve hours a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
for a disinterested employer, he fails to appreciate
his opportunity. He is diseased, degenerate.
His sisters are without chastity,
every one, polluting the good, pure white
men about them. He is a rapist, and it is
his criminal tendencies that are degrading
America. The pale-faced ones of his family
steal into white society, marry, and insinuate
grasping, avaricious tendencies into the
noble, generous men of white blood, causing
them to cheat in business and to practise
political corruption. In short there is nothing
evil that Ezekiel is not at the bottom of.
Sometimes, poor little chap, he tries to sniffle
out a word, to say that his family is doing
well, that he has an uncle who is buying a
home, and a rich cousin in the undertaking
business, but such extenuating circumstances
receive scant attention, and we are not surprised
to find, the class dismissed, that
Ezekiel and the millions whom he represents,
are swiftly shuffled off the earth, victims of
"disease, vice, and profound discouragement."</p>

<p>Now this is not an exaggerated picture
of much that has recently been printed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
newspaper and magazine, and does it not
make us feel the paradox that if we are to
judge the Negro fairly, we must not judge
him at all, so little are we temperamentally
capable of meeting the first requirement?</p>

<p>"My brother Saxons," says Matthew
Arnold, "have a terrible way with them of
wanting to improve everything but themselves
off the face of the earth." And he
adds, "I have no such passion for finding
nothing but myself everywhere." Among
our American writers a few, like Arnold, do
not care to find only themselves everywhere,
and these have told us a different story of
the American Negro. They are poets and
writers of fiction, men and women who are
happy in meeting and appreciating different
types of human beings.<a name="FNanchor_70_3" id="FNanchor_70_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> If these writers
were to instruct us, they would say that we
must individualize more when we think of
the black people about us, must differentiate.
That, too, we must remember that when we
pass judgment, we need to know whether our
own standard is the best, whether we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
not have something to learn from the standards
of others. Supposing Ezekiel is deliberate
and slow to make changes or to take
risks; are we who are "acceleration mad,"
who acquire heart disease hustling to catch
trains, who <a name="tn4" id="tn4"></a>mortgage our farms to buy automobiles,
who seek continually new sensations,
really better than he? Is it not a
matter of difference, just as we may each
place in different order our desires, the one
choosing struggle for power and the accumulation
of wealth, the other preferring serenity
and pleasure in the immediate present?
And lastly, after having praised our own
virtues and our own ideals, must we not
beware that we do not blame the Negro
when he adopts them, that we do not turn
upon him and fiercely demand only servile
virtues, the virtues that make him useful not
to himself but to us?<a name="FNanchor_71_4" id="FNanchor_71_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>
<p>No one can talk for long of the Negro in
America without propounding the all-embracing
question, What will become of him,
what will be the outcome of all this racial
controversy? It is a daring person who
attempts to answer. We, who have studied
the Negro in New York, may perhaps venture
to predict a little regarding his future
in this city, his possible status in the later
years of the century; whether he will lose in
opportunity and social position, or whether
he will advance in his struggle to be a man.</p>

<p>Looking upon the great population of the
city, its varied races and nationalities, I
confess that his outlook to me begins to be
bright. New York is still to a quite remarkable
extent dominated socially by its old
American stock, its Dutch and Anglo-Saxon
element. Few things strike the foreign
visitor so forcibly as that despite its enormous
European population, American society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
is homogeneous. But this is not likely to
continue for very long. When the present
demand for exhausting self-supporting work
becomes less insistent, we shall feel in a
deeper, more vital way the influence of our
vast foreign life. With a million Jews and
nearly a million Latin people, we cannot for
long be held in the provincialism of to-day.
I suspect that to many Europeans New
York seems still a great overgrown village
in "a nation of villagers," pronouncing with
narrow, dogmatic assurance upon the deep
unsolved problems of life. But in the future
it may take on a larger, more cosmopolitan
spirit. Its Italians may bring a finer feeling
for beauty and wholesome gayety, its Jews
may continue to add great intellectual
achievements, and its people of African
descent, perhaps always few in number, may
show with happy spontaneity their best and
highest gifts. If New York really becomes
a cosmopolitan city, let us believe the Negro
will bring to it his highest genius and will
walk through it simply, quietly, unnoticed,
a man among men.</p>

belonging to a servile class. Emphasis is laid upon his responsibilities
to the white man, not upon the white man's responsibilities
to him. Any one familiar with the sympathetic
attitude toward the workers in such a study as the <i>Pittsburg
Survey</i> will notice at once the difference in attitude in Negro
surveys by whites, the slight emphasis laid upon the black
laborers' long hours and poor pay, and the failure to emphasize
the white man's responsibility. Negro laborers are still
studied from the viewpoint of the capitalist. There is one
notable exception to this, the study by the governor of
Jamaica, Sir Sidney Olivier, on "White Capital and Coloured
Labor."</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
